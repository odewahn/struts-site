                    The latest
                    <em>development build</em>
                    of Apache Struts products are available

                    in binary, source and library distributions.
                    Library distributions include any external dependencies
                    needed to use a product with your application.

                <p>
                    Development builds are being reviewed for quality
                    by the Apache Struts community.
                    When a build is judged "ready for prime time",
                    it is promoted to "General Availability" status and may be
                    made
                    the "Best Available" release.
                    If the community feels that a build requires more testing,
                    then it may be marked with "Beta" status.

                    Access to the Apache Struts source repository is available
                    through
                    both

                <p>
                    To download the trunk (HEAD revision) of all Struts
                    subprojects,
                    a convenience directory has been added, named
                    <b>current</b>
                    .
                    The current directory uses a Subversion feature called
                    externals
                    which stores properties on the directory.
                    With those properties,
                    Subversion has all the information it needs to
                    automaticaly download
                    the head revision of all the Struts subprojects.
                </p>

                    With the
                    <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion
                        client</a>
                    installed, obtaining a working copy of the Struts codebase
                    is as simple as
                </p>

                <code>&gt; svn checkout
                    http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/current</code>

                <p>
                    While Externals work well in practice, there are caveats.
                    For example,
                    since all the subdirectories are still really different
                    slices
                    from the repository,
                    relative paths might not work the way you expect.

                    If you try to check out everything under 'struts',
                    be aware that you will get not just the most recent code
                    ('trunk'),
                    but a copy of every tag and branch ever created
                    for Struts.
                    A complete checkout of Struts from day one, including all
                    the branches,
                    will take some time and might max out your disk volume!

                <p>
                    If you are building Struts source,
                    we recommend that you install and use
                    <a href="http://maven.apache.org">
                        Apache Maven 2.</a>
                    During the build process, Maven will automatically acquire 
                    whatever external JARs your system may need.
                    (Of course,
                    you can still use your build system of choice to build
                    your own applications!)
                </p>

                <p>
                    With Maven installed, building a Struts codebase is as 
                    simple as
                </p>

                <code>/current/struts1/&gt; mvn install</code>
                
                <p>
                or
                </p>
                
                <code>/current/struts2/&gt; mvn install</code>

                <p>
                    Maven will automatically download any dependencies as
                    needed.
                </p>
