            <p>
              Please join us in welcoming Dave Newton as a new Struts committer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dave's been doing "yeoman work" on the user list for some time now,
              filing issues, and helping with the documentation. It's likely that
              he's edited the most documentation pages of any non-committer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Welcome, Dave, now you can update the JavaDocs to better match the
              Confluence pages!

              Please join us in welcoming Brian Pontarelli as a new Struts committer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Brian developed the SmartURLs plugin, which is being merged with the
              CodeBehind plugin for bundling with Struts 2.1. The original
              CodeBehind plugin and Zero-Configuration code, developed by Don Brown,
              was loosely based on the ASP.NET approach. Brian's SmartURLs plugin
              gives the original approach a more Struts-like spin and adds SEO URIs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Welcome, Brian, I think we're all looking forward to an agile, XML-free future!

              Over many years, Matt Raible has been one the most involved members of
              our community, for Struts 1, Struts 2, and WebWork. He's also a member
              of the Apache Roller project, which recently migrated from Struts 1 to
              Struts 2. Though sometimes critical, his comments are always meant to
              be constructive. He's participated in over fifty JIRA tickets, and
              over a hundred threads on struts-user and struts-dev. Of course, many
              of us have also met Matt, since he frequently attends ApacheCon and
              other conventions.

            <h4 id="a20070708">8 July 2007 - Struts Downloads Skyrocket in 2007</h4>

            <p>
              Since its release in June 2001, Apache Struts
              (struts.apache.org) has become the most popular web framework
              for Java. Six years later, by any objective measure, Struts is
              still Java's most popular web framework.
            </p>
            <p>
              In February and March 2007, the group released both Struts 1.3.8
              and Struts 2.0.6 to the general public, and Struts downloads
              zoomed to over 340,000 a month from the Apache site alone [1].
              And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Most copies of Struts
              are downloaded from an network of mirrors or obtained from Maven
              repositories. Meanwhile, monthly page Views for the Struts
              website soared to over 2.1 million, up from levels of about 1.3
              million page views in June 2004. Subscriptions to the Struts
              mailing lists hold steady at about 3,000 accounts, not counting
              people who use services like Nabble and GMane.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the framework's debut, well over twenty books about Apache
              Struts have been published [2], along with hundreds of online
              articles, and dozens of third-party extensions [3]. Books and
              articles devoted to Struts 2 are already appearing. InfoQ has
              released "Starting with Struts2" both as a free PDF and as a
              hardcopy book via LuLu.com [4]. Mark Menard has started a Struts
              2 cookbook [5], and sites like Rose India and ArcTech are
              offering extensive Struts 2 tutorials [6]. Many teams are
              already moving Struts 1 applications to Struts 2, including the
              popular Apache Roller blogging application [7].
            </p>
            <p>
              An exciting feature of Struts 2 is configuration-free plugins.
              Third-party components can be added to the framework just by
              putting a JAR on the Java classpath. In fact, many of the
              framework's advanced features are provided by plugins that ship
              with Struts 2. A plugin repository site is open to the public
              [8], and several plugins are already available, including
              plugins for JSON, WebFlow, Google Web Toolkit, and Guice.
            </p>
            <p>
              While there is no lack of choice in the Java framework space,
              the clear winner with grassroots developers is still Apache
              Struts. With first-class support for Ajax, JSF, unit testing,
              and dependency injection, Struts 2 is an excellent choice for
              teams that want to step forward, without stepping away.

            <h4 id="a20070612">12 June 2007 - Struts v2.0.8 GA Release</h4>

            <p>
              The Apache Struts group is pleased to announce that Struts 2.0.8
              is available as a "General Availability" release. The GA
              designation is our highest quality grade.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apache Struts 2 is an elegant, extensible framework for
              creating enterprise-ready Java web applications. The framework
              is designed to streamline the full development cycle, from
              building, to deploying, to maintaining applications over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apache Struts 2 was originally known as WebWork 2. After working
              independently for several years, the WebWork and Struts
              communities joined forces to create Struts2. This new version of
              Struts is simpler to use and closer to how Struts was always
              meant to be.
            </p>

            <li>

                    <strong>Improved Design</strong> - Code clean against HTTP-independent framework interfaces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhanced Tags</strong> - Code less with stylesheet-driven form tags that provide their own markup.

                <li>
                    <strong>Stateful Checkboxes</strong> - Avoid special handling with smart checkboxes that know when they are toggled.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Flexible Cancel Buttons</strong> - Go directly to a different action on cancel.

                <li>
                    <strong>POJO forms</strong> -  No more ActionForms! Use any JavaBean to capture form input or

                <li>

                </li>
                <li>

                    <strong>Intelligent Defaults</strong> - Skip obvious and redundant settings. Most framework configuration

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy-to-customize controller</strong> - Customize the request handling
                    per action, if desired. Struts<sup>2</sup> only does what you want it to do!

                <li>
                    <strong>Integrating Debugging</strong> - Research problem reports with built-in

            <h4 id="a20070310">10 March 2007 - Struts v1.3.8 GA Release</h4>
            <p>
              The Apache Struts group is pleased to announce that Struts 1.3.8
              is available as a "General Availability" release. The GA
              designation is our highest quality grade.
            </p>

            <p>
              This release has over 40 bug fixes and improvements since 1.3.5!
              New Features include:
            </p>

            <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Action ID</strong><br />
                New <code>actionId</code> attribute to uniquely identify action mappings
                within a module. Just as the TilesRequestProcessor could recognize a tile
                definition and resolve it to the intended JSP, so does Struts now have
                built-in recognition for URIs that begin with an actionId and will
                automatically translate forwards.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>I18N Properties</strong><br />
                Tag libraries now include the HTML I18N properties. This allows sites
                that specialize in internationalization to specify both bi-directional
                text and language at the tag level.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Dynamic Link Parameters</strong><br />
                The Struts &lt;html:link&gt;, &lt;html:frame&gt;, &lt;html:rewrite&gt; tag
                libraries now allow their bodies to nest the new &lt;html:param&gt; tag.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Property MessageResources Modes</strong><br />
                Compatibility mode option which allows message resources to operate in
                modes compatible with either JSTL or PropertyResourceBundle.
            </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
               Struts 1.3.8 is available in a full distribution, or as separate
               library, source, example and documentation distributions.
            </p>

            <h4 id="a20070223">22 Feb 2007 - Struts v2.0.6 GA Release</h4>

            <p>
              The Apache Struts group is pleased to announce that Struts 2.0.6
              is available as a "General Availability" release. The GA
              designation is our highest quality grade.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apache Struts 2 is an elegant, extensible framework for
              creating enterprise-ready Java web applications. The framework
              is designed to streamline the full development cycle, from
              building, to deploying, to maintaining applications over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apache Struts 2 was originally known as WebWork 2. After working
              independently for several years, the WebWork and Struts
              communities joined forces to create Struts2. This new version of
              Struts is simpler to use and closer to how Struts was always
              meant to be.
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Build!</em>
                <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy startup</strong> - Jumpstart new projects with our bootstrap tutorial and template application or Maven archetype.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Improved Design</strong> - Code clean against HTTP-independent framework interfaces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhanced Tags</strong> - Code less with stylesheet-driven form tags that provide their own markup.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stateful Checkboxes</strong> - Avoid special handling with smart checkboxes that know when they are toggled.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Flexible Cancel Buttons</strong> - Go directly to a different action on cancel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>First-class AJAX support</strong> - Add interactivity and flexibility with AJAX tags that look and feel just like standard Struts tags.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy Spring integration</strong> - Inject dependencies into Actions using Spring without glue code or red tape. (Plexus support also available.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhanced Results</strong> - Do more with specialty results for JasperReports, JFreeChart, Action chaining, and file downloading.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>POJO forms</strong> -  No more ActionForms! Use any JavaBean to capture form input or
                    put properties directly on an Action class. Use both binary and String properties!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>POJO Actions</strong> - Use any class as an Action class -- even the
                    interface is optional!
                </li>
                </ul></li>

                <li>
                    <em>Deploy!</em>

                <li>
                    <strong>Easy plugins</strong> - Add framework extensions by dropping in a JAR.
                    No manual configuration required! Bundled plugins add support for JavaServer Faces,
                    JasperReports, JFreeChart, Tiles, and more ...
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Integrated profiling</strong> - Peek inside Struts<sup>2</sup> to find where the cycles are going!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Precise Error Reporting</strong> - Flip directly to the location and line of an error.
                </li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>
                <em>Maintain!</em>
                <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy-to-test Actions</strong> - Test Struts<sup>2</sup> Actions directly,

                <li>
                    <strong>Intelligent Defaults</strong> - Skip obvious and redundant settings. Most framework configuration
                    elements have a default value that we can set and forget. Say it once!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy-to-customize controller</strong> - Customize the request handling
                    per action, if desired. Struts<sup>2</sup> only does what you want it to do!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Integrating Debugging</strong> - Research problem reports with built-in
                    debugging tools.
                </li>

                    <strong>Easy-to-tweak tags</strong> - Customize tag markup by editing a FreeMarker

                    <em>JSP, FreeMarker, and Velocity tags are fully supported.</em>
                </li>
