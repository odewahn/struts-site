            <p>
                The Apache Struts group is pleased to announce that Struts 2.0.14 is

                Apache Struts 2 is an elegant, extensible framework for creating
                enterprise-ready Java web applications. The framework is designed to
                streamline the full development cycle, from building, to deploying, to
                maintaining applications over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                This release is a bugfix release for version 2.0.12, which provided important
                security fixes.
                Struts 2.0.14 addresses two major bugs introduced with these security fixes,
                keeping the FilterDispatcher from serving built in static resources,
                and keeping conversion error messages from being displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
                All developers are strongly encouraged to update existing Struts 2 applications
                to Struts 2.0.14.
            </p>
            <p>
                Struts 2.0.14 is available in a full distribution,
                or as separate library, source, example and documentation
                distributions, from the
                <a href="http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts2014">releases page</a>.

            </p>

                requirement of the following specification versions: Servlet API 2.4,
                JSP API 2.0, Java 5, Backported Java 4 JARs are also available.
