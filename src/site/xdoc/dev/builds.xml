            <p>
                As a convenience to developers who are helping to create and
                maintain the Apache Struts framework,
                public access to the live source code repository is available.
                This is our one-and-only development repository.
                Accordingly, the source may not always compile
                or be in a release-ready state.
                <em>Access at your own risk!</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                NOTE: The full source code is provided with each
                <a href="../downloads.html">release.</a> 
                If you simply want to build your own copy of the product,
                use the source code provided with an approved release, 
                rather than the development head.
            </p>

            <p>
                Read-only access to the Apache Struts source repository is available
                through both
                <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/struts/?root=Apache-SVN">
                    web browser</a>
                and
                <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">
                    Subversion client</a>
                interfaces.
            </p>

            <p>
                To download the trunk (HEAD revision) of all Struts
                subprojects,
                a convenience directory has been added, named
                <b>current</b>.
                The current directory uses a Subversion feature called
                externals which stores properties on the directory.
                With those properties,
                Subversion has all the information it needs to
                automaticaly download
                the head revision of all the Struts subprojects.
            </p>

            <p>
                With the
                <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion
                    client</a>
                installed, obtaining a working copy of the Struts codebase
                is as simple as
            </p>

            <code>&gt; svn checkout
                http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/current</code>

            <p>
                While Externals work well in practice, there are caveats.
                For example,
                since all the subdirectories are still really different
                slices
                from the repository,
                relative paths might not work the way you expect.
                For more, see the
                <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s04.html">

            </p>

            <p>
                To check out individual sub-projects from the Subversion
                repository,
                you can specify one of the following URLs:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/struts1/trunk</li>

                (Committers with write access should use the
                <strong>https</strong>
                protocol instead.

            <p>
                <strong>Warning:</strong>
                If you try to check out everything under 'struts',
                be aware that you will get not just the most recent code
                ('trunk'),
                but a copy of every tag and branch ever created
                for Struts.
                A complete checkout of Struts from day one, including all
                the branches,
                will take some time and might max out your disk volume!
            </p>

        <subsection name="Building Apache Struts">

            <p>
                If you are building Apache Struts from source,
                we recommend that you install and use
                <a href="http://maven.apache.org">
                    Apache Maven 2.</a>
                During the build process, Maven will automatically acquire
                whatever external JARs your system may need.
                (Of course,
                you can still use your build system of choice to build
                your own applications!)
            </p>

            <p>
                With Maven installed, building a Struts codebase is as
                simple as
            </p>

            <code>/current/struts1/&gt; mvn install</code>

            <p>
            or
            </p>

            <code>/current/struts2/&gt; mvn install</code>

            <p>
                Maven will automatically download any dependencies as
                needed.
            </p>

                    As part of our continuous integration practice,
                    we also make available each morning the
                    <a href="https://builds.apache.org/job/Struts2/lastStableBuild/org.apache.struts$struts2-assembly/">
                        latest stable development build.</a>

                <p>
                    If you do <strong>not</strong> plan to contribute to the development of the framework,
                    then you probably want to download a
                    <a href="../downloads.html">release</a> instead.
                </p>

              <p>
                NOTE: The Struts 2 nightly build is not fully operational.
                We suggest that contributors checkout the <a href="#SourceCode">source code</a> instead.

                    As we prepare for a new release, 
                    the project group may create interim 
                    <em>test builds</em>. 
                    When test builds are available, 
                    we post them 
                    <a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/struts/">here</a>
                    in binary, source and library distributions.
                    Library distributions include any external dependencies
                    needed to use a product with your application.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A test build is made available so that it can be reviewed for quality
                    by the Apache Struts development group.
                    When a build is judged "ready for prime time",
                    it is promoted to "General Availability" status and may be
                    made the "Best Available" release.
                    If the group feels that a build requires more testing,
                    then it may be marked as "Beta" release. 
                    When a test build is upgraded to "Beta" or "GA" 
                    by a vote of the project members, 
                    we make the distribution available as 
                    a formal <a href="../downloads.html">release.</a>

            <p>
                    When a distribution is first made available, 
                    it is rated as a development build or "snapshot". 
                    Later, the quality of the distribution may be upgraded to 
                    "Beta" or "General Availability", based on feedback from 
                    the community, and then made available through ibiblio and 
                    other public Maven repositories. 
                    To obtain an early distribution via Maven, 
                    specify the ASF Snapshot repository in the project's POM.
