            <p>
                Apache Struts is an open-source framework for creating 
                Java web applications, based on the classic 
                Model-View-Controller design. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Web applications differ from conventional websites in that 
                web applications can create a dynamic response. 
                Most websites deliver only static pages. 
                A web application can interact with databases and 
                business logic engines to customize a response.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the Struts framework, requests first pass through an 
                extensible "front controller". 
                After pre-processing the request and applying any global 
                concerns, like logging and security, the controller 
                selects a handler, or "action". 
                The action manages the business logic and transfers 
                control to another resource that will complete the 
                response, such as a JavaServer Page, Velocity Template, 
                or PDF report generator. 
                To close the loop, the framework provides custom tags 
                that make it easier for pages to access the dynamic data 
                obtained through the action handler. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The framework's architecture and tags are buzzword compliant. 
                Struts works well with conventional REST applications
                and with nouveau technologies like SOAP and AJAX. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The project is called "Struts" because the framework is meant to 
                provide the "invisible underpinnings" that support professional 
                application development. 
                Struts provides the glue that joins the various elements
                of the standard Java platform into a coherent whole. 
                Our goal is to leverage existing standards by providing the 
                missing pieces we need to create enterprise-grade applications 
                that are easy to maintain over time.

            <p>
                The Apache Struts Project is the open source community 
                that creates and maintains the the Apache Struts framework. 
                The project consists of a diverse group of volunteers who 
                share common values regarding collaborative, community-based 
                open source development. 
                The Apache Struts Project is proud to share these values with 
                our parent organization: The Apache Software Foundation.                                
            </p>
                        
            <p>

                The Apache Sruts Project offers two major versions of the 
                Struts framework. <strong>Struts 1</strong> is recognized as 
                <em>the</em> most popular web application framework for Java. 
                The 1.x framework is mature, well-documented, and widely 
                supported. 
                Struts 1 is the best choice for teams who value proven 
                solutions.
            </p>
                        
            <p>
                <strong>Struts 2</strong> is a ground-up rewrite of the original 
                action-centric framework.
                Struts 2 was originally known as 
                <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork">WebWork 2</a>. 
                After working independently for several years, 
                the WebWork and Struts communities  
                <a href="announce-2005.html#a20051214.3">joined forces</a>
                to create Struts 2.
                The new framework is the best choice for teams who value 
                elegant solutions to difficult problems. 
            </p>
                        
            <p>
                Struts 2 is still under construction. An initial release is 
                expected in the third quarter of 2006.
            </p>

                <p>
                    Shale started as an Apache Struts subproject and then 
                    <a href="announce.html#a20060628.1">graduated</a>
                    to a full top-level Apache project in its own right.  
                    Apache Shale builds on JavaServer Faces (JSF), making JSF 
                    applications easier to develop. For details, visit the
