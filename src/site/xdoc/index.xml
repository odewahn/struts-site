        <section name="Apache Struts">

            <p>
                Apache Struts is a free open-source framework for creating 
                Java web applications. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Web applications differ from conventional websites in that 
                web applications can create a dynamic response. 
                Many websites deliver only static pages. 
                A web application can interact with databases and 
                business logic engines to customize a response.
            </p>

            <p>
                 Web applications based on JavaServer Pages sometimes 
                 commingle database code, page design code, and control 
                 flow code.
                 In practice, we find that unless these concerns are 
                 separated, 
                 larger applications become difficult to maintain. 
            </p>

            <p>
                 One way to separate concerns in a software application is to 
                 use a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
                 The <em>Model</em> represents the business or database code, 
                 the <em>View</em> represents the page design code, 
                 and the <em>Controller</em> represents the navigational code. 
                 The Struts framework is designed to help developers create 
                 web applications that utilize a MVC architecture. 
            </p>

            <p>
                  The framework provides three key components:
           </p>
                         
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                          A "request" handler provided by the application developer 
                          that is mapped to a standard URI.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          A "response" handler that transfers control to another resource 
                          which completes the response.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          A tag library that helps developers create interactive 
                          form-based applications with server pages.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                        
            <p>
                The framework's architecture and tags are buzzword compliant. 
                Struts works well with conventional REST applications
                and with nouveau technologies like SOAP and AJAX. 
            </p>

        <section name="The Apache Struts Project">
        
            <p>
                The Apache Struts Project is the open source community 
                that creates and maintains the Apache Struts framework. 
                The project consists of a diverse group of volunteers who 
                share common values regarding collaborative, community-based 
                open source development. 
                The Apache Struts Project is proud to share these values with 
                our parent organization: The Apache Software Foundation.                                
            </p>
                        
            <p>
                The project is called "Struts" because the framework is meant to 
                furnish the "invisible underpinnings" that support professional 
                application development. 
                Struts provides the glue that joins the various elements
                of the standard Java platform into a coherent whole. 
                Our goal is to leverage existing standards by producing the 
                missing pieces we need to create enterprise-grade applications 
                that are easy to maintain over time. 
            </p>
       
            <p>

                The Apache Struts Project offers two major versions of the 
                Struts framework. 
                <a href="http://struts.apache.org/1.x/index.html">Struts 1</a> 
                is recognized as 
                <em>the</em> most popular web application framework for Java. 
                The 1.x framework is mature, well-documented, and widely 
                supported. 
                Struts 1 is the best choice for teams who value proven 
                solutions to common problems.
            </p>
                        
            <p>
                <a href="http://struts.apache.org/2.x/index.html">Struts 2</a> 
                was originally known as 
                <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork">WebWork 2</a>. 
                After working independently for several years, 
                the WebWork and Struts communities  
                <a href="announce-2005.html#a20051214.3">joined forces</a>
                to create Struts 2.
                The new framework is the best choice for teams who value 
                elegant solutions to difficult problems. 
            </p>
                        
            <p>
                A stable release of Struts 2 is expected in the fourth 
                quarter of 2006. 
                An intitial <a href="downloads.html">BETA release</a> 
                is now available.

                <p>
                    Shale started as an Apache Struts subproject and then 
                    <a href="announce.html#a20060628.1">graduated</a>
                    to a full top-level Apache project in its own right.  
                    Apache Shale builds on JavaServer Faces (JSF), making JSF 
                    applications easier to develop. For details, visit the
