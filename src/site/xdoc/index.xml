        <section name="Apache Struts">

            <p>
                Apache Struts is a free open-source framework for creating
                Java web applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                Web applications differ from conventional websites in that
                web applications can create a dynamic response.
                Many websites deliver only static pages.
                A web application can interact with databases and
                business logic engines to customize a response.
            </p>

            <p>
                 Web applications based on JavaServer Pages sometimes
                 commingle database code, page design code, and control
                 flow code.
                 In practice, we find that unless these concerns are
                 separated,
                 larger applications become difficult to maintain.
            </p>

            <p>
                 One way to separate concerns in a software application is to
                 use a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
                 The <em>Model</em> represents the business or database code,
                 the <em>View</em> represents the page design code,
                 and the <em>Controller</em> represents the navigational code.
                 The Struts framework is designed to help developers create
                 web applications that utilize a MVC architecture.
            </p>

            <p>
                  The framework provides three key components:
           </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                          A "request" handler provided by the application developer
                          that is mapped to a standard URI.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          A "response" handler that transfers control to another resource
                          which completes the response.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          A tag library that helps developers create interactive
                          form-based applications with server pages.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            <p>
                The framework's architecture and tags are buzzword compliant.
                Struts works well with conventional REST applications
                and with nouveau technologies like SOAP and AJAX.
            </p>

        <section name="The Apache Struts Project">

            <p>
                The Apache Struts Project is the open source community
                that creates and maintains the Apache Struts framework.
                The project consists of a diverse group of volunteers who
                share common values regarding collaborative, community-based
                open source development.
                The Apache Struts Project is proud to share these values with
                our parent organization: The Apache Software Foundation.
            </p>

            <p>
                The project is called "Struts" because the framework is meant to
                furnish the "invisible underpinnings" that support professional
                application development.
                Struts provides the glue that joins the various elements
                of the standard Java platform into a coherent whole.
                Our goal is to leverage existing standards by producing the
                missing pieces we need to create enterprise-grade applications
                that are easy to maintain over time.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Apache Struts Project offers two major versions of the
                Struts framework.
                Struts 1 is recognized as
                <em>the</em> most popular web application framework for Java.
                The 1.x framework is mature, well-documented, and widely
                supported.
                Struts 1 is the best choice for teams who value proven
                solutions to common problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                Struts 2 was originally known as
                <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork">WebWork 2</a>.
                After working independently for several years,
                the WebWork and Struts communities
                <a href="announce-2005.html#a20051214.3">joined forces</a>
                to create Struts 2.
                The 2.x framework is the best choice for teams who value
                elegant solutions to difficult problems.
