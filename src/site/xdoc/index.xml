        <section name="Welcome to Apache Struts!">
            <p>
                Apache Struts is a web development framework based on the "Model 2" approach, a variation of
                the
                classic Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm.
                Under Model 2,
                a servlet (or equivalent) manages business logic execution,
                and presentation logic resides mainly in server pages.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Apache Struts project makes web development easier in two
                ways.
                First, by providing an open source framework (briefly known as the 
                Struts Action Framework)
                that helps developers build applications for the web.
                Second, by providing friendly and honest
                <a href="mail.html">mailing lists</a>
                where both newcomers and veterans discuss how to use Apache Struts
                software in their own Model 2 applications.

                        <strong>Struts 1.2.9,</strong>

                    which was classified "General Availability"
                    (or "Ready for Primetime") on 22 March 2006.
                    The 1.2.9 release

                        resolves three security issues,</a>
                    and supercedes the Struts 1.2.8 release.

                    <a href="http://struts.apache.org/struts-shale">Struts Shale</a>
                    started as a Struts subproject, but
                    later <a href="announce.html#a20060628.1">graduated</a>
                    to a full top level Apache project.  Apache Shale, as it is now
                    called, builds on JavaServer Faces (JSF), making JSF applications easier to 
                    develop.  Until the new Apache Struts project gets established, its pages
                    are still located at

                <p>
                    The Apache Struts project is now comprised of two distinct
                    versions of the Struts framework.
                    The two versions are 
                    <strong>Struts 1</strong>
                    and the
                    <strong>Struts 2.</strong>
                    Struts 1 is the original request-based framework that has a large and 
                    active following.  Struts 2
                    started with a merger with the <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork">
                    Opensymphony WebWork</a> project and aims to exploit Java 5 annotations
                    and other modern web framework features in an effort to make Struts easier to
                    use and more powerful. Both versions are actively developed and supported by
                    the Apache Struts project.
                </p>

                    Whether you are staying the course, or ready to leap forward,
                    the Apache Struts project is here to help you do what you want
                    to do.

            <subsection name="About Apache Struts">
                <p>
                    Apache Struts is a volunteer project and
                    all support for the framework is provided by unpaid
                    volunteers.
                    The documentation bundled with each release and the mailing 
                    lists are the primary ways to learn how to use the software.
                    The next few pages are devoted to helping everyone understand
                    what support resources are available.
                    Since Apache Struts is a volunteer project,
                    and our resources are limited,
                    it is important that we first help you help yourself.
