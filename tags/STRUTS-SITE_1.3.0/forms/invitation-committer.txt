${candidate},

On behalf of the Apache Struts PMC, I would like to extend to you an invitation
to become a Struts Committer. If you might be interested, please be sure to
review the 'How the ASF Works' pages:

* http://apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html

along with the Apache Struts PMC charter:

* http://struts.apache.org/bylaws.html

If you decide to accept the invitation, the first step would be to file an
Individual Contributor License Agreement:

* http://apache.org/licenses/cla.txt

If you have an intellectual property agreement with your employer, they may
also need to file a corporate agreement:

* http://apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt

The next step would be to send your first three choices for an Apache account
name to the Struts PMC Chair:

* Martin Cooper <martinc@apache.org>

Once the account is set up, you would be able to commit to the Struts source
repository.

We do hope that you will be able to join us.

Thank you for your sustained efforts in helping us build not only great
software, but a great community.
