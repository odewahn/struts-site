${candidate},

The Struts Project Management Committee (PMC) has voted to invite you to join
the PMC. As you're most likely aware, the PMC is the body that is ultimately
responsible for the project, and its members are the people who have binding
votes and ultimately make all the final decisions. With this, of course, comes
the responsibility to maintain oversight of the project.

Please let me know as soon as possible whether or not you'd like to accept
this invitation. And thanks for your continued contributions to Struts!
