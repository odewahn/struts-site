            <question>What can my company do to help support Apache
                Struts?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Apache Struts is an all volunteer product.
                    Our customers are the volunteers who donate their time and
                    energy to
                    supporting the product.
                    If you want to support Apache Struts, and become one of our
                    customers,
                    then you need to get involved and become a volunteer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our challenge to any team using an Apache Struts product
                    is to donate the time of one team member
                    one afternoon a week (or more if you can spare the
                    resources).
                    Have your team member browse
                    <a href="#issues">JIRA</a>
                    for any issues
                    without a
                    <a href="#patches">patch</a>
                    or unit test,
                    and
                    <a href="#contribute">add the patch or test.</a>
                    (Please note that we do not use @author tags in our
                    JavaDocs an documentation.)
                    If your patch includes an @author tag, we would have to
                    ask that it be removed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If an Apache Struts product doesn't do what
                    <em>you</em>
                    want,
                    it's up to
                    <strong>you</strong>
                    to step up and propose the patch.
                    If an Apache Struts product doesn't ship as often as you
                    would like,
                    it's up to you to step up with the tests and fixes that
                    get a release out
                    the door.
                    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/contributing.html">
                        (Like Craig
                        McClanahan did for Tomcat.)</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    If Struts does do what you want, help others become
                    involved by turning your
                    war stories into FAQs and how-tos that we can make part of
                    the
                    <a href="#documentation">documentation.</a>
                    The mailing list is very active and
                    trundling through the archives is no picnic.
                    We can always use volunteers who can reduce the best
                    threads
                    to coherent articles we can share with others.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We don't sell Struts for money, but anyone who wants to be
                    our customer
                    can pay us back by donating the time and energy that money
                    represents.

        <faq id="patches">
            <question>How do I create a patch?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    A patch is a machine-readable script that can
                    automatically
                    recreate a change to a text file, including source code
                    and
                    documentation.
                    The patch format is also human-readable.
                    Developers often pass patches around to discuss a change
                    before
                    applying it to the main repository.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The best way to affect a change to the source code or
                    documentation
                    is to provide a patch.
                    Apache Struts committers can then review your patch and
                    decide
                    whether to apply it to the main repository.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please be aware that the Struts project follows general coding
                    conventions. In short, these are the official Java coding conventions
                    plus the rule to favor spaces over tabs for indenting. See more
                    details at <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/S2WIKI/Struts+2+Coding+Conventions">
                    Struts 2 Coding Conventions (Wiki)</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    To create a patch, you first have to
                    <a href="downloads.html#Source_Code">
                        checkout</a>
                    a copy of the source code or documentation from the main
                    repository.
                    You can then change your copy, and create the patch using
                    a simple
                    <a href="http://subversion.org/">Subversion</a>
                    command, like this:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <code>svn diff Main.java &gt;&gt; patchfile.txt</code>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then, create a
                    <a href="#issues">JIRA
                        issue</a>
                    about the change, and attach the patch file.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some Apache projects ask that you to submit your patch to
                    the mailing
                    list.
                    We would prefer that you create a
                    JIRA issue and then attach the patch to the issue.
                    To do this, you must first create the issue,
                    and then modify the report to add your patch.
                    We realize this is a bit clumsy, but it keeps us from
                    losing things,
                    and helps to ensure that your patch will be attended.
                </p>

                    <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/community/contribute/patches.html">
                        NetBeans community</a>
                    also has a helpful section on the
                    subject of creating patches.

            <question>How can I report defects or suggest features?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Tracking of defect reports and enhancement suggestions for
                    Apache Struts
                    products is handled
                    through the
                    <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WW">Apache Struts 
                        JIRA instance.</a>
                    Please select the appropriate Apache Struts product from 
                    the list, 
                    and then select the component to which you feel this report
                    relates.
                    You will automatically be notified by email as the status
                    of your defect or
                    enhancement report changes.
                    Please be sure to read
                    <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">
                        How to
                        Report Bugs Effectively</a>
                    before posting a report.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you can't write a
                    <a href="#patches">patch</a>
                    to address your issue,
                    a unit test that demonstrates the problem is also welcome.
                    (And, of course, unit tests that prove your patch works
                    are equally welcome.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the defect or feature is already being tracked,
                    you can vote for the issue and call more attention to it.
                    Each user can cast up to six votes at a time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If there is a patch attached to the issue, you can also
                    try applying
                    to your local copy of Struts, and report whether it worked
                    for you.
                    Feedback from developers regarding a proposed patch is
                    really quite
                    helpful.
                    Don't hesitate to add a "works for me" note to a ticket
                    if you've tried the patch yourself and found it useful.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Feature suggestions are also maintained in the

                    A very good place to start is by
                    <strong>reviewing the list of open issues</strong>

                    If you see an issue that needs a patch you can write,
                    feel free to annex your patch.
                    If you see an issue that needs a unit test to prove it's
                    fixed,
                    feel free to annex your test case.
                    If someone has posted a patch to an issue you'd like to
                    see resolved,
                    apply the patch to your local development copy of Struts.
                    Then let us know if it works for you, and if it does,
                    cast your vote for the issue and its patch.

                    If none of the pending issues scratch your itch,
                    another good place to start is by
                    <strong>contributing unit tests</strong>
                    for existing features (even those that still work).

                    you can go back and upload a

                <p>
                    Our current approach to
                    <a href="kickstart.html#tests">unit testing</a>
                    works fairly well for exercising most method-level stuff,
                    but does
                    not really address situations of dynamic behavior -- most
                    particularly the
                    execution of custom tags for Struts.
                    You can try to fake what a JSP container does, but a much
                    more reliable
                    testing regime would actually execute the tag in a real
                    container.
                    For that purpose, we use the
                    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus">Cactus</a>
                    testing framework,
                    which re-executes the JUnit-based tests as well to make
                    sure that nothing
                    bad happens when you switch environments.
                    Right now, there are very few dynamic tests; ideally, we
                    will have tests
                    for every tag, that cover every reasonable combination of
                    tag attribute
                    values (yes, that's a tall order -- the totally lines of
                    test source code
                    will undoubtedly exceed the totally lines of code in the
                    framework itself
                    if we achieve this).

                    <code>xdocs</code>
                    folder for the subproject.
                    To build just the documentation for a subproject,

                    Procedurally, the only difference between patching
                    the Struts 1 documentation and
                    software is that the docs are kept in XML rather than
                    Java
                    source code.
                    Otherwise, all the same instructions pertain.

                    important to
                    provide patches and new pages in the XML source.
                    Otherwise, some other volunteer will have to do this
                    for
                    you, and it may
                    never get done.

                    the
                    documentation.
                    Again, someone has to figure that out before it can be
                    added,
                    and that someone might as well be you.

                    This will make it easier to add your contribution to

                <p>
                    The trick to getting started is to download the
                    nightly
                    build and try
                    building the subproject's site.
                    Then try adding your own XML page under xdocs/ to see
                    if
                    the build succeeds.
                    If it doesn't, it will report where the bad element
                    is,
                    much like it reports
                    where a bad programming expression is.
                    If it does, then your page should be available under
                    target/site/
                </p>

                <p>
                    To display markup, substitute &amp;lt; for &lt;.
                    The unmatched trailing > will be ignored.
                    Since it is XML, all elements also need to closed.
                    So elements like &lt;br> and &lt;hr> need to set out
                    as
                    &lt;br/> and &lt;hr/>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also watch for the length of code samples - these do

                    wrap.
                    If a line is too long,

        <faq id="release">
            <question>So when is the next release coming out?</question>
            <answer>

                <p>
                    Here is the truth regarding releases:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Apache products are released on the basis of merit,
                    and ~not~ according to a strict timetable.
                    The volunteers devote whatever time they can to work
                    on
                    the product.
                    But all volunteers have real jobs and real lives, that
                    do
                    take precedence.
                    Since Struts does not have paid personnel working on
                    the
                    project,
                    we simply cannot make date-oriented commitments.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The bottom line is that Apache takes releases very
                    seriously.
                    We do not compromise the quality of our software by
                    watching the calendar
                    (and then ship something ready or not).
                    A release is ready when it is ready.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That may sound flip, but it ~is~ the truth.
                    The delivery of production-quality, leading-edge
                    software
                    is
                    not something anyone can prognosticate.
                    If anyone tries, they are lying to you.
                    That, we won't do ;-)
                </p>

                <p>
                    What we ~will~ do is release all of our development
                    software as soon as
                    it is developed.
                    This way you can judge for yourself how quickly the
                    development is
                    proceeding, and whether what is being developed will
                    meet
                    your needs.
                    If you need a feature right now, you can use the
                    nightly
                    build, or roll
                    your own patch.
                    There are no internal code repositories, private
                    development lists,
                    secret chat rooms, or conference calls.
                    What you see is what we got.
                    If you are following the DEV list, then you know
                    everything the
                    developers know.
                    Really, you do.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>So, what do you tell your team?</em>
                    If you can ship your application based on the nightly
                    build of your choice,
                    then consider that an option.
                    You can still ship yours, even if we don't ship ours,
                    and you will have access to all the latest patches or
                    enhancements.
                    (Just like we were working down the hall.)
                    If you can only ship your application based on a
                    release
                    build of Struts,
                    then you should base your development on the release
                    build
                    of Struts,
                    and keep an eye on what is coming down the pipeline.
                    This way you are at least forewarned and forearmed.

                        Every modification to the ticket is echoed to the

                        automatically subjected to peer review.

            <question>How can I help make the decisions?</question>
            <answer>

                <p>
                    A guiding principle of the Apache Software Foundation is
                    "them that do the work, make the decisions".
                    This phrase is actually a double-entendre.
                    A project will make some decisions by voting (very few),
                    but the real decisions are made when a volunteer actually
                    does the
                    work.
                    Unless someone volunteers to do the work,
                    other decisions are meaningless.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In an ASF project, like Apache Struts,
                    volunteers who make sustained contributions to the project
                    are invited to become "Committers".
                    In due course, Committers are invited to join the Project
                    Management
                    Committee (PMC).
                    A goal of the ASF is for all Committers to be on the PMC.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By "sustained", we mean that an individual has been active
                    in the project for at least six months.
                    The contributions should come in the form of both patches
                    (to code or documentation), and posts to the mailing
                    lists.
                    Patches must be competent and accepted into the
                    repository.
                    Posts must be consistently helpful, friendly, and
                    collaborative.
                    The most important characteristic in a prospective
                    Committer is an
                    amicable demeanor that fosters goodwill.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As PMC members take note of Struts developers who meet our
                    qualifications, one of us will call for a vote on the
                    internal
                    PMC mailing list.
                    (This usually happens when someone gets tired of applying
                    the volunteer's patches!)
                    The internal list is rarely used, and it is never used for
                    development discussions.
                    If the PMC vote passes, we will send the developer a
                    invitation
                    privately, to give the individual a chance to accept or
                    discretely
                    decline.
                    If the candidate is able to accept,
                    the PMC will announce the new member on the dev list.
