# From a birds eye

## The Apache Struts web framework

The Apache Struts web framework is a free open-source solution for
creating Java web applications.

Web applications differ from conventional websites in that web applications
can create a dynamic response. Many websites deliver only static pages.
A web application can interact with databases and business logic engines
to customize a response.

Web applications based on JavaServer Pages sometimes commingle database
code, page design code, and control flow code. In practice, we find that
unless these concerns are separated, larger applications become
difficult to maintain.

One way to separate concerns in a software application is to use a
Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The Model represents the business or
database code, the View represents the page design code, and the Controller
represents the navigational code. The Struts framework is designed to help
developers create web applications that utilize a MVC architecture.

The framework provides three key components:

A "request" handler provided by the application developer that is mapped to a standard URI.
A "response" handler that transfers control to another resource which completes the response.
A tag library that helps developers create interactive form-based applications with server pages.
The framework's architecture and tags are buzzword compliant. Struts works
well with conventional REST applications and with technologies like SOAP and AJAX.

## The Apache Struts Project

The Apache Struts Project is the open source community that creates and maintains
the Apache Struts framework. The project consists of a diverse group of volunteers
who share common values regarding collaborative, community-based open source development.
The Apache Struts Project is proud to share these values with our parent organization:
The Apache Software Foundation.

The project is called "Struts" because the framework is meant to furnish the
"invisible underpinnings" that support professional application development.
Struts provides the glue that joins the various elements of the standard Java platform
into a coherent whole. Our goal is to leverage existing standards by producing the missing
pieces we need to create enterprise-grade applications that are easy to maintain over time.

Long time the Apache Struts Project offered two major versions of the Struts framework.
Meanwhile we maintaining only Struts 2. It is recommended to upgrade all Struts 1.x
application to Struts 2. Please do not start any more applications on top of Struts 1.x,
as you will not receive security patches any more.

Struts 2 was originally known as WebWork 2. After working independently for several years,
the WebWork and Struts communities joined forces to create Struts 2. The 2.x framework
is the best choice for teams who value elegant solutions to difficult problems.
