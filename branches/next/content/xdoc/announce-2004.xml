                The Apache Struts team is proud to announce the release of

                We invite your comments on how well this release works with
                your own applications. Based on feedback from the Struts
                community, this release may be dubbed "ready for prime time"
                and promoted to "General Availabilty" quality.

                Please note that Struts now uses "Tomcat-style" releases. If
                the feedback on this release were positive, Struts 1.2.1 may
                be promoted directly to "GA", without creating yet-another
                distribution. If a serious problem were found and fixed, then
                we will issue Struts 1.2.2 and try again.
