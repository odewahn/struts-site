            <p>
                A mailing list is an electronic discussion forum that anyone
                can subscribe to. When someone sends an email message to the
                mailing list, a copy of that message is broadcast to everyone who is
                subscribed to that mailing list. Mailing lists are the primary means of
                communication for people working within the Apache Struts Project.
            </p>

                A message sent to a public mailing list
                cannot be unpublished. Although we might be able to modify our own
                mail archives, the message is mirrored to a lot of other archiving
                systems which we do not have under control. Therefore
                almost 100% of all delete requests are denied. Please make
                sure you <strong>do not send any potential sensitive information to the mailing list</strong>,
                including passwords, server names, ips and so on.

                <p>
                    Mailing lists provide a simple and effective communication
                    mechanism. With potentially thousands of subscribers, there is a
                    common set of etiquette guidelines that you should observe. Please keep
                    on reading.
                </p>

                <p class="alert alert-box alert-error">

                        Join the lists that are appropriate for your
                        discussion.
                    </strong>
                    <br/>
                    Please make sure that you are joining the list that is
                    appropriate for the topic or product that you would like to discuss. For
                    example, please do not join the Struts mailing list and ask
                    questions about Tomcat. Instead, you should join the Tomcat User list and ask your
                    questions there.
                </p>

                <h3><a name="respect">Respect the mailing list type</a></h3>

                <p>
                    The "User" list is where you can send questions and comments about
                    configuration, setup, usage and other "user" types of questions.
                    The focus of the user list should be one "how" to do
                    something with the framework we have today.
                    The focus of the dev list is how we want to do something
                    with a future version of the framework.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The "Developer" (or "Dev") list is where you can send questions and
                    comments about the actual software source code and general
                    "development" types of questions. Questions about the "future" of Struts are
                    best addressed to the dev list.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some questions may seem appropriate for posting on both the
                    "user" and the "developer" lists. In this case, pick one and only one.
                    Do not cross post, unless a Committer asks that the
                    thread be moved to the other list.
                </p>

                <h3><a name="post">Do not cross post messages.</a></h3>
                <p>
                    In other words, pick a mailing list and send your messages
                    to that mailing list only. Do not send your messages to multiple mailing
                    lists. The reason is that people may be subscribed to one list and not to the
                    other. Therefore, some people will only see part of the conversation.
                </p>

                <h3><a name="reply-to">Watch where you are sending email.</a></h3>
                <p>
                    The majority of our mailing lists have set the Reply-To to
                    go back to the list. That means that when you Reply to a message, it will
                    go to the list and not to the original author directly. The reason is
                    because it helps facilitate discussion on the list for everyone to benefit
                    from. Be careful of this as sometimes you may intend to reply to a message
                    directly to someone instead of the entire list.
                </p>

                <h3><a name="plain">Do not send HTMLÂ emails to the list.</a></h3>
                <p>
                    If you are using Outlook or Outlook Express or Eudora,
                    chances are that you are sending HTML email by default. There is usually a
                    setting that will allow you to send "Plain Text" email.
                </p>

                <h3><a name="short">Keep your email short and to the point.</a></h3>
                <p>
                    If your email is more than about a page of text, chances
                    are that it won't get read by very many people. It is much better to
                    try to pack a lot of informative information (see above about asking
                    smart questions) into as small of an email as possible. If you are replying
                    to a previous email, it is a good idea to only quote the parts that you
                    are replying to and to remove the unnecessary bits. This makes it
                    easier for people to follow a thread as well as making the email archives
                    easier to search and read.

                        "In Internet terminology, a troll is a person who posts rude or offensive messages on the
                        Internet, such as in online discussion forums, to disrupt discussion or to upset its
                        participants (see Anonymous Internet posting). "Troll" can also mean the message itself or be a
                        verb meaning to post such messages. "Trolling" is also commonly used to describe the activity."

                    If someone makes an off-topic post that offends you,
                    our best advice is to filter posts from that person to the trash.
                    When subscribers do choose to respond, sometimes a thread
                    will feed on itself, and grow out of control.
                    When that happens, our best advice is to filter the entire thread to the trash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our spam filters will catch most types of commercial spam,
                    but troll spam is a hard for software to spot.
                    The best defense is to withhold from the troll what he or she wants most: A response.

                <p>
                    Every volunteer project obtains its strength from the
                    people involved in it. You are welcome to join any of our mailing lists.
                    You can choose to lurk, or actively participate; it's up to you.
                    The level of community responsiveness to specific questions is
                    generally directly proportional to the amount of effort you spend formulating
                    your question. Eric Raymond and Rick Moen have even written an
                    essay entitled
                    <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">&quot;Asking Smart Questions&quot;</a>
                    precisely on this topic. Please read the essay, follow its advice,
                    and then post your smart questions to the appropriate list.
