             <h4 id="a20101220">20 December 2010 - Struts 2.2.1.1 General Availability Release</h4>
            <p>
              The Apache Struts group is pleased to announce that Struts 2.2.1.1 is
              available as a "General Availability" release. The GA designation is our
              highest quality grade.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apache Struts 2 is an elegant, extensible framework for creating
              enterprise-ready Java web applications. The framework is designed to
              streamline the full development cycle, from building, to deploying, to
              maintaining applications over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              This release includes one important security fix regarding Dynamic Method
              Invocation in the REST Plugin. In the previous versions DMI wasn't under control
              in the REST Plugin and even setting struts.enable.DynamicMethodInvocation to false
              didn't block DMI in the REST Plugin.
            </p>
            <p>
              All developers are strongly advised to update existing Struts 2 applications
              to Struts 2.2.1.1.
            </p>
            <p>
              Struts 2.2.1.1 is available in a full distribution,
              or as separate library, source, example and documentation
              distributions, from the
              <a href="http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts2211">releases page</a>.
              The release is also available through the central Maven repository under Group ID
              "org.apache.struts". The
              <a href="http://struts.apache.org/2.2.1.1/docs/version-notes-2211.html">release notes</a>
              are available online.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 2.2.x series of the Apache Struts framework has a minimum
              requirement of the following specification versions: Servlet API 2.4,
              JSP API 2.0, and Java 5.
            </p>
            <p>
              Should any issues arise with your use of any version of the Struts
              framework, please post your comments to the user list, and, if
              appropriate, file a tracking ticket.
            </p>
