            <h4 id="a20091116">16 November 2009 - Struts 2.1.8.1 General Availability Release</h4>
            <p>
              The Apache Struts group is pleased to announce that Struts 2.1.8.1 is
              available as a "General Availability" release. The GA designation is our
              highest quality grade.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apache Struts 2 is an elegant, extensible framework for creating
              enterprise-ready Java web applications. The framework is designed to
              streamline the full development cycle, from building, to deploying, to
              maintaining applications over time.
            </p>  
            <p>
              This release is a significant upgrade. We have worked hard to improve
              some of the trouble spots from 2.0. In particular, we are releasing a
              new plugin for XML-free configuration called the Conventions Plugin. This
              release also features the new REST and Javatemplates plugins. The
              AJAX functionality has been moved to a plugin to improve maintainability.
              Many bugs have been fixed for this release, see release notes for more
              details.
            </p>  
            <p>
              Struts 2.0 will continue to be supported, but for new projects, we
              suggest moving to Struts 2.1.
            </p>  
            <p>
              Struts 2.1.8.1 is available in a full distribution, or as separate
              library, source, example and documentation distributions, from the
              releases page. The release is also available through the central Maven
              repository under Group ID "org.apache.struts". The release notes are
              available online.
            </p>  
            <p>
              The 2.1.x series of the Apache Struts framework has a minimum
              requirement of the following specification versions: Servlet API 2.4,
              JSP API 2.0, and Java 5.
            </p>  
            <p>
              Should any issues arise with your use of any version of the Struts
              framework, please post your comments to the user list, and, if
              appropriate, file a tracking ticket.
