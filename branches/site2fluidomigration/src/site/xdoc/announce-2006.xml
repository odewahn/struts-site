            <h4 id="a20061107">07 Nov 2006 - Struts v2.0.1 BETA Release</h4>

            <p>
            The Apache Struts project is pleased to announce the availability of
            the <a href="http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts201">
            Struts 2.0.1 BETA release</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
            Apache Struts 2 is an elegant, extensible framework, well suited for
            enterprise-ready Java web applications.
            The framework is designed to streamline the full development cycle,
            from building, to deploying, to maintaining applications over time.
            </p>

            <p>
            Apache Struts 2 was originally known as WebWork 2.
            After working independently for several years,
            the WebWork and Struts communities joined forces to create Struts<sup>2</sup>.
            This new version of Struts is simpler to use and closer to how
            Struts was always meant to be.
            </p>

            <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Build!</em>
                <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy startup</strong> - A Maven archetype, template application, and bootstrap
                    tutorial help jumpstart new projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Improved Design</strong> - All framework classes are based on interfaces.
                    Core interfaces are HTTP independent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhanced Results</strong> - Unlike ActionForwards, Struts<sup>2</sup> Results can
                    actually help prepare the response.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhanced Tags</strong> - Struts<sup>2</sup> tags don't just output data, but provide
                    stylesheet-driven markup, so that we can create consistent pages with less code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stateful Checkboxes</strong> - Struts<sup>2</sup> checkboxes do not require special
                    handling for false values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy cancel handling</strong> - The Struts<sup>2</sup> Cancel button can go directly to
                    a different action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>POJO forms</strong> - No more ActionForms! We can use any JavaBean we like or
                    put properties directly on our Action classes. No need to use all String properties!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>POJO Actions</strong> - Any class can be used as an Action class. Even the
                    interface is optional!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy Spring integration</strong> - Struts<sup>2</sup> Actions are Spring-aware. Just
                    add Spring beans!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>First-class AJAX support</strong> - The AJAX theme gives interactive
                    applications a boost.
                </li>
                </ul></li>

                <li>
                    <em>Deploy!</em>
                <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>QuickStart</strong> - Configuration files are reloadable so many changes
                    can be made on the fly without restarting a web container.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy plugins</strong> - Framework extensions can be added by dropping in a JAR.
                    No manual configuration required! Bundled plugins add support for JavaServer Faces,
                    JasperReports, JFreeChart, Tiles, and more ...
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy portlets</strong> - Automatic portlet support allows portal and servlet
                    deployments with no code changes.

                <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy-to-test Actions</strong> - Struts<sup>2</sup> Actions are HTTP independent and
                    can be tested without resorting to mock objects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Intelligent Defaults</strong> - Most framework configuration elements have a default
                    value that we can set and forget.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy-to-customize controller</strong> - Struts 1 lets us customize the request
                    processor per module, Struts<sup>2</sup> lets us customize the request handling
                    per action, if desired.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy-to-tweak tags</strong> - Struts<sup>2</sup> tag markup can be altered by changing
                    an underlying stylesheet. Individual tag markup can be changed by
                    editing a FreeMarker template. No need to grok the taglib API!
                    <em>JSP, FreeMarker, and Velocity tags are fully supported.</em>
                </li>

            <h4 id="a20060818.1">18 Aug 2006 - Struts v1.3.5 Beta</h4>

            <p>The Apache Struts team is pleased to announce the release of Struts 1.3.5 Beta.</p>

            <p>Struts 1.3.5 is available in a full distribution, or as separate library, source, example and
                documentation distributions.</p>

            <p><a href="http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts135">
            http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts135</a></p>

            <p>It is also available in the central Maven repository under Group ID
            "org.apache.struts".</p>

            <p>Major changes since Struts 1.2 include</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Composable Request Processor</li>
                <li>Arbitrary configuration properties</li>
                <li>Opt-In Cancel Handling</li>
                <li>Enhanced Global Exception Handlers</li>
                <li>Extends attribute</li>
                <li>"isCommitted" Exception Handling</li>
                <li>Postback Actions</li>
                <li>Wildcard ActionConfig properties</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Composable Request Processor: For Struts 1.3, we turned the request processor methods into Commands that
                are part of a flexible Chain of Commands.</p>

            <p>Arbitrary configuration properties: Most every Struts configuration element now accepts a map of
                key/value pairs. Arbitrary configuration properties let us externalize more of our configurations,
                encouraging reuse.</p>

            <p>Opt-In Cancel Handling: In Struts 1.3, the Cancel token is only honored if the new property "cancellable"
                is set for the Action Mapping. If the Cancel token is present, but cancellable is not set, then an
                InvalidCancelException is thrown. The InvalidCancelExeption may be caught by a Declarative Exception
                Handler, like any other Exception.</p>

            <p>Enhanced Global Exception Handlers: We now support use of global exception handlers in cases when no
                ActionConfig has yet been identified, as in with "preprocessing" commands in a custom request processing
                chain.</p>

            <p>Extends attribute: In the Struts configuration file, we can now use the extends attribute to adopt
                default settings from another element, as we already can in the Tiles configuration files.</p>

            <p>"isCommitted" Exception Handling: When using Tiles, sometimes the response is already committed when an
                exception occurs. Now, the ExceptionHandler tests response.isCommitted, and, if true, includes the
                configured view path, rather than forwarding to it.</p>

            <p>Postback Forms: The action attribute of the Form taglib is now optional. If omitted, the original URI of
                the original request is used.</p>

            <p>Wildcard ActionConfig properties: Wildcards can now be used in the properties of an ActionConfig.</p>

            <p>The 1.3.x series of the Apache Struts framework has a minumum requirement of the following specification
                versions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Java Servlet 2.3 and JavaServer Pages (JSP) 1.2</li>
                <li>Java 2 Standard Platform Edition (J2SE) 1.4</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 id="a20060628.1">28 Jun 2006 - Shale to Become Top-Level
                ASF Project</h4>
            <p>
               On behalf of the ASF Board and Struts PMC, we are pleased to
               announce that Shale has been accepted as a top-level project of
               the Apache Software Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
               As a top-level project, Shale will have its own website, mailing
               lists, repository space, and Project Management Committee. Shale
               will be an automomous ASF project, rather than a subproject of
               Apache Struts.
            </p>
            <p>
               The Shale framework for JavaServer Faces is nearing its first
               stable release. As a top-level project, it will be easier for
               Shale to attract new developers and expand its growing community.
            </p>


           <p>
               The initial set of PMC members and committers for Shale is
               Craig McClanahan, James Mitchell, Greg Reddin, Sean Schofield,
               Wendy Smoak, Gary VanMatre, Matthias Wessendorf.
            </p>

            <p>
               Apache Shale has strong ties to both the Struts and MyFaces
               projects. Most of the Shale PMC members are already involved
               in both projects and plan on continuing to remain involved in
               them, along with Shale.
            </p>

            <p>
               Apache Shale is a modern web application framework, intended for
               developers adopting JavaServer Faces as a core technology.
            </p>

            <p>
               Shale began as a proposal for Struts 2.0, but instead became a
               subproject, so as to provide a JSF alternative for Struts
               developers. Recent developments for Struts 2 now make it
               easier for Struts developers to access JSF components from within
               an "action-based" application.
            </p>

            <p>
               The initial Shale codebase was donated by Craig McClanahan, who
               also donated the original Struts codebase.
            </p>

            <p>
            [Note: To accomodate Shale, the original framework had been given
            the name "Action". Now that Shale has graduated, the "Action"
            label is being dropped, and Struts is just Struts again.]

            <h4 id="a20050328">23 Mar 2006 - Struts Shale Framework 1.0.2 Alpha</h4>
            <p>
                The Struts team is pleased to announce the release of Struts Shale 1.0.2 Alpha.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://struts.apache.org/downloads.html">
                        http://struts.apache.org/downloads.html</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Struts Shale Framework is a set of loosely coupled services,
                fundamentally based on JavaServer Faces, which may be combined as
                needed to meet particular application requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Compared to version 1.0.0 (version 1.0.1 was retired due to packaging
                issues), this version includes a substantial number of bugfixes and
                enhancements -- details are in the Release Notes -- and the following
                major new features:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Shale Remoting is a complete overhaul of the remoting support in
                    1.0.0, providing support for application or component developers who
                    need to implement the server side behavior for AJAX callbacks. It is
                    packaged as a small (40k) JAR that has no dependencies on the rest of
                    Shale.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tiger Extensions is an optional add-on layer for those running on
                    Java SE 5 (code named "Tiger"). The extensions let you use Java
                    annotations to declare managed beans or register JSF components,
                    without needing entries in a faces-config.xml file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A new "blank" starter application to get you up and running with a
                    new project quickly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A new "mailreader" demo application that duplicates the
                    functionality of the Struts 1.x version of this app, so you can
                </li>
                <li>
                    A new "SQL Browser" demo application that illustrates use of the
                    Tiger Extensions, as well as the ability to modify JSF component trees
                    on the fly.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Although this is considered an alpha release, various developer APIs
                should be considered at a more stable (in terms of assurances of
                backwards compatibility in future releases) point than might otherwise
                be expected. Please see the following web page for more details:

                The Struts team is pleased to announce the release of Struts
                Scripting
                1.0.1 for General Availability. This is the first stable
                release of
                Struts Scripting (formerly Struts BSF). It allows Struts
                Actions to be

                to be
                written in any language BSF supports like Perl, Python, Ruby,
                JavaScript, Groovy, and even VBScript.
