Apache Struts releases Struts 1.3.0 as the "Action Framework" 

13 Dec 2005 - The Apache Struts flagship product, the leading web application framework for Java, is now known as the 
"Struts Action Framework". 

To make the framework easier to maintain, Apache Struts subdivided the original monolithic distribution into several subprojects. Each subproject has its own website, documentation, and release cycle, and may be downloaded separately. For consistency, the original core framework component also has its own name now: "Struts Action Framework". The JARs and external dependencies for the extensions to Struts Action Framework are being bundled into a convenient distribution known as the "Struts Action Framework Library".

The Struts Action Framework 1.3.0 release includes several exciting new features, including: 

* Composable Request Processor
* ActionDynaForm interfaces
* Arbitrary configuration properties
* Catalog and Command Elements
* Enhanced Global Exception Handlers
* Extends attribute for XML configurations
* "isCommitted" Exception Handling
* Postback Actions
* Wildcard ActionConfig properties

The key change in this release is the "composable request processor". The request processor is the framework's "kernal". The request processor methods are now command objects in a flexible chain of commands. Rather than subclassing a monolithic object, developers can now just replace commands with their own implementations. Commands can also be inserted or removed, if needed, to extend or streamline the request processing gauntlet, to better meet the needs of different kinds of applications.

The Struts Action Framework 1.3.0 release, and other milestones on the Apache Struts roadmap, are being discussed at ApacheCon today in a talk, entitled "Struts 2006: An Embarrassment of Riches".

Apache Struts offers "Shale" for JSF

13 Dec 2005 - To give JavaServer Faces developers a head start on building scalable web applications for the enterprise, Apache Struts now offers the Shale Framework. Like the original "Struts Action Framework", Shale provides developers with a front controller, and several other components, to provide the "invisible underpinnings that hold an application together".

"When JavaServer Faces arrived," explains the Struts website, "our development community chose to 'make new friends but keep the old'. Some of us want (or need) to stick with the original request-based framework. Others are ready to switch to an component-based framework that builds on JavaServer Faces. We offer both frameworks because we have volunteers to create and maintain both frameworks."

Shale is based on the recenty standardized JavaServer Faces APIs, and focuses on adding value, rather than redundantly implementing features that JSF already provides. Shale will run on any compliant JSF implementation, including the one being developed by the Apache MyFaces project. It also includes many features that Struts users appreciate, such as supporting client side validation and the Tiles framework.

Struts Shale is being discussed by Craig McClanahan in a talk at ApacheCon today, entitled "Shale: The Next Struts?".

Apache Struts to release "standalone" Tiles 

13 Dec 2005 - Apache Struts introduced Tiles as a integral component of its Struts 1.1 release in June 2003. Since then, several other projects have been using Tiles, even though it was embedded in the Struts JAR. Soon, it will be much easier to use Tiles with products like Jakarta Velocity, Apache MyFaces, and Struts Shale. 

Tiles is a templating framework that can be used to create a common look and feel for a web site or application and to create reusable view components. A key aspect of Tiles is that it can be configured from a XML configuration file. A Tile definition can "extend" another definition, giving the component an object-oriented feel. Tile developers can create a base Tile (or screen layout), and then indicate only how other Tiles differ from the base. Changes made to a base Tile "cascade" to Tiles that extend that base. Significant changes can be made to the layout of a website just by changing a single Tile definition.

Apache Struts and Open Symphony WebWork communities to merge 

13 Dec 2005 - Apache Struts, the leading web application framework for Java, and Open Symphony WebWork, a leader in technical innovation, are working to merge their codebases and communities. 

"A merger is an elegant approach to evolution of existing applications based on action-oriented frameworks," said Craig McClanahan, founder of the Struts project. 

The merger seems like a win-win for the frameworks. "The technical benefit is that WebWork has already done most everything that is on the Struts Action roadmap," noted Ted Husted, a Struts committer. "This is a way that [Struts] shops can use incremental integration to take advantage of new technologies that are already part of WebWork, like Spring and Rife."

"My hope is to take advantage of a larger community (Struts) to allow all of us to do a bit less individual effort." said Patrick Lightbody of WebWork. "I would expect moving to Struts lets us focus on our families and day jobs a bit more."

Apache projects help developers balance day jobs with volunteer work through the practice of collaborative developement. Decisions are made jointly by the core community, rather than by one or two key individuals. The projects are organized so that individual developers can focus on other matters for a time, and then return to the development community as schedules allow. 

Over the past few months, Apache Struts has more than doubled its number of active committers. With the addition of two WebWork developers, there are about fifteen active volunteers. Right now, about half of the committers are working on the original Struts Action Framework and half are working on the new Struts Shale Framework, which utilizes JavaServer Faces. Several volunteers are now working with both frameworks.

The merger and other milestones on the Apache Struts roadmap are being discussed in a talk at ApacheCon today, entitled "Struts 2006: An Embarrassment of Riches". The talk will be presented by Lightbody, Husted, and Don Brown, another Struts Committer. The Struts Shale framework is being discussed at a second talk, presented by McClanahan, entitled "Shale: The Next Struts??".
