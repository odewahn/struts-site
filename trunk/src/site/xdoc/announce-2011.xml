            <h4 id="a20111218">18 December 2011 - Struts 2.0.14 End of Life Announcement</h4>
            <p>
                The Apache Struts Team likes to inform you that the Struts 2.0 branch has reached it's end of life
                and is no longer supported. All users of Struts 2.0.14 or earlier Struts 2 versions are strongly
                advised to update their existing applications to Struts 2.3.x.
            </p>
            <p>
                Struts 2.0.14 was for some time maintained in parallel to the 2.1 and 2.2 branches, since Struts 2.1
                introduced some API and plugin changes that were likely to break existing user code on top of Struts 2.
                However, the community interest in maintaining the Struts 2.0.x branch was not strong enough to
                keep it sufficiently up to date, especially in terms of security fixes. There are several serious
                security problems that, while being continuously addressed in later Struts 2 versions, did not make
                it into the 2.0.x branch. For that reason the Apache Struts PMC decided to remove 2.0.14 as a supported
                version.
            </p>
            <p>
                For more information on how to upgrade existing applications running on top of Struts 2.0.x to
                Struts 2.1 and later, please read the
