# Apache Struts 1 End-Of-Life (EOL) Press Release

**2013-04-05 - The Apache Struts Project Team would like to inform you that the Struts 1.x web framework has reached its end of life and is no longer officially supported.**

Started in 2000 to create an improved development experience over pure Java Server Pages (JSP) utilization,
Struts 1 soon became the de-facto standard for Java-based web application development.
Numerous companies adopted Struts 1 as a strategic platform and stayed with it even after JSF was introduced
as a standardized Java EE framework for web application development. In the early 2000s, most job offerings in the
space of Java-based web technology came with Struts 1 as a must-have skill.
Even nowadays many important web sites and web based user interfaces rely on Struts 1 technology.
It is furthermore remarkable that many later introduced web frameworks such as Spring MVC or WebWork
were crucially inspired by Struts 1.

Struts 1 had its last release - version 1.3.10 - in December 2008. In the meantime the Struts community has
focused on pushing the Struts 2 framework forward, with as many as 23 releases as of this writing. Taking this
into account, announcing Struts 1 EOL is just the official statement that we have been lacking volunteer support
for some time now and that users should not rely on a properly maintained framework state when utilizing
Struts 1 in their projects.

As far as the Apache Struts team is currently aware of, there is no urgent issue posing the immediate need to
eliminate Struts 1 usage from user projects. However, users should be aware that security and bug fixes will
no longer be provided. Apart from that, all Struts 1 related resources and downloads will be accessible from
the [Apache Struts project homepage][1] now and in future.

While generally possible, the Apache Struts project team would not recommend to start new projects based
on Struts 1 any more. Project teams are advised to examine alternative web frameworks instead.
While any action based Java web framework is a potential candidate to re-use Struts 1 architectural
experience or migrate existing Struts-1-based applications, the Apache Struts team can highly recommend investigating
Struts 2 as a successor framework. Struts 2 is modern, highly decoupled, feature rich, well maintained and
successfully running in many mission critical projects in the wild. It shares the same basic principles with
Struts 1, but offers a highly improved architecture, API and solution portfolio. Other alternatives include
Spring Web MVC, Grails or Stripes.
