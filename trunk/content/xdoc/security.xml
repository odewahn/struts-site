        <section name="Reporting New Security Issues with Apache Struts">

            <p>
              The Apache Struts project takes a very active stance in
              eliminating security problems and denial of service attacks
              against applications using the Apache Struts framework.
            </p>

            <p><strong>
              We strongly encourage folks to report such security problems to our
              private security mailing list first, before disclosing them
              in a public forum.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              We cannot accept regular bug reports or other queries at
              this address, we ask that you use our
              <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WW">issue tracker (JIRA)</a>
              for those. <span style="color:red;">All mail sent to this
              address that does not relate to security problems in the Apache
              Struts source code will be ignored.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that all networked servers are subject to denial of service
              attacks, and we cannot promise magic workarounds to generic problems
              (such as a client streaming lots of data to your server, or re-requesting
              the same URL repeatedly). In general our philosophy is to avoid any
              attacks which can cause the server to consume resources in a non-linear
              relationship to the size of inputs.
            </p>

            <p>
              The mailing address is:
              <code>security at struts (dot) apache (dot) org</code>
