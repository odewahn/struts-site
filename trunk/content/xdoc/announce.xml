            <h4 id="a20130306">6 March 2013 - Struts 2.3.12 General Availability Release</h4>
            <p>
                The Apache Struts group is pleased to announce that Struts 2.3.12 is
                available as a "General Availability" release. The GA designation is our
                highest quality grade.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apache Struts 2 is an elegant, extensible framework for creating
                enterprise-ready Java web applications. The framework is designed to
                streamline the full development cycle, from building, to deploying, to
                maintaining applications over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a mostly maintenance release but few important improvements were added as well:
                <ul>
                    <li>All validators were refactored and right now parameters can be set via OGNL also parameter parse was removed</li>
                    <li>Tag's required attribute was renamed to requiredLabel to allow support of Html5 required attribute in the tags</li>
                    <li>New Tiles 3 plugin was added to support Tiles 3 result type</li>
                    <li>Support for JBoss 5 to work with the Convention Plugin was improved</li>
                </ul>
                Please check the Version Notes to see more details.
            </p>
            <p>
                All developers are strongly advised to update existing Struts 2 applications to Struts 2.3.12.
            </p>
            <p>
                Struts 2.3.12 is available in a full distribution or as separate library, source, example and documentation
                distributions, from the
                <a href="http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts2312">releases page</a>.
