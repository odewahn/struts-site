            <p>
                The Apache Struts group is pleased to announce that Struts 2.3.8 is
                available as a "General Availability" release. The GA designation is our

                Apache Struts 2 is an elegant, extensible framework for creating
                enterprise-ready Java web applications. The framework is designed to
                streamline the full development cycle, from building, to deploying, to
                maintaining applications over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a mostly maintenance release which improves overall performance which should be significant
                better than in version 2.3.7 and slightly better than in version 2.3.4.1. This version depends on new OGNL
                version 3.0.6 - thanks to Pelladi Gabor and Johno Crawford for their contribution!
                Please check the Version Notes to see more details.
            </p>
            <p>
                All developers are strongly advised to update existing Struts 2 applications
                to Struts 2.3.8.
            </p>
            <p>
                Struts 2.3.8 is available in a full distribution or as separate library, source, example and documentation
                distributions, from the
                <a href="http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts238">releases page</a>.
