    <section name="Acquiring Apache Struts products">

    <p>
        Apache Struts products are made available to the public at no charge
        in both binary and source distributions under the
        <a href="http://apache.org/licenses/">Apache Software License</a>.
        Each subproject offers a production release, as well as a milestone
        releases and "nightly" development builds.
        Individual JARs are also made available through
        <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Apache Maven</a> repositories,
        like <a href="http://ibiblio.org">ibiblio</a>.
    </p>

<subsection name="Releases and Milestone Builds">
<a name="ReleasesAndMilestones"/>
    <p>
    Releases and milestone builds of Struts products are available from
    the main Apache Struts distribution site, or from mirror sites.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>General Availability (GA) Releases</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi">
              Struts 1.2.8
            </a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

        <strong>Older Releases</strong> are available from the

<subsection name="Development Builds">

    <p>
        The latest <em>development build</em> of Struts products are available
        <a href="http://svn.apache.org/dist/struts/">here</a>
        in binary, source and library distributions.
        Library distributions include any external depdencies
        needed to use a product with your application.
    </p>

    <p>
        Development builds are being reviewed for quality
        by the Apache Struts community.
        When a build is judged "ready for prime time",
        it is promoted to "General Availability" status and may be made
        the "Best Available" release.
        If the community feel that a build requires more testing,
        then it may be marked with "Beta" status.
    </p>

<a name="NightlyBuilds"/>
<subsection name="Nightly Builds">

    <p>
        For developers who are helping to create and maintain Struts products,
        or who just want "the latest bits",
        the latest development version is made available each morning.
        Use at your own risk!
    </p>

    <p>
        Apache Struts development builds are managed using
        <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven</a>.
        Maven acquires the various JARs needed by Struts products
        and automaticaly shares JARs between Struts subprojects and other
        Maven projects.
    </p>

     <ul>

    <li>
        <a href="http://svn.apache.org/builds/struts/maven/">Nightly Builds</a>.
    </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
        Be sure to check the Release Notes for a nightly build,
        so you have a better idea of what you are getting!

<a name="SourceCode"/>
<subsection name="Source Code">

    <p>
        Access to the Apache Struts source repository is available through
        both
        <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/struts/action/trunk/?root=Apache-SVN">
        web browser</a> and
        <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">
        Subversion client</a> interfaces. 
    </p>
        
    <p>
        To download the trunk (HEAD revision) of any Struts subproject,
        a convenience directory has been added, named <b>current</b>.
        The current directory uses a Subversion feature called externals
        which stores properties on the directory.
        With those properties,
        Subversion has all the information it needs to automaticaly download
        the head revision of all the Struts subprojects.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	With the <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/"> Subversion client</a> 
    	installed, obtaining a working copy of the Struts codebase is as simple as
    </p>
    
    	<code>&gt; svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/current</code>
        
    <p>
        While Externals work well in practice, there are caveats.
        For example,
        since all the subdirectories are still really different slices
        from the repository,
        relative paths might not work the way you expect.
        For more, see the
        <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s04.html">Externals
        Definitions</a> section of the
        <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Subversion Book</a>.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        To check out individual sub-projects from the Subversion repository,
        you can specify one of the following URLs:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/action/trunk</li>
      <li>http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/apps/trunk</li>
      <li>http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/el/trunk</li>
      <li>http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/faces/trunk</li>
      <li>http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/flow/trunk</li>
      <li>http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/sandbox/trunk</li>

      <li>http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/taglib/trunk</li>
      <li>http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/tiles/trunk</li>
    </ul>

    See the ASF <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html#https-svn">
    Source Code Repositories</a> page for details.)
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Warning:</strong>
        If you try to check out everything under 'struts',
        be aware that you will get not just the most recent code ('trunk'),
        but a copy of every tag and branch ever created
        for Struts.
        A complete checkout of Struts from day one, including all the branches, 
        will take some time and might max out your disk volume!
    </p>

<subsection name="Building Struts">

    <p>
        If you are building a Struts subproject from source,
        we recommend that you install and use <a href="http://maven.apache.org">
        Apache Maven</a> 1.0.2,
        since Maven will acquire whatever external JARs your system may need.
        Of course,
        you can still use your build system of choice to build your own
        applications!
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	With Maven installed, building the entire Struts codebase is as simple as 
    </p>

    	<code>/current/build/&gt; maven build-all</code>
    
    <p>
    	Maven will automatically download any dependencies as needed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	For more about using Maven to build Apache Struts, 
    	see our <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/struts/StrutsMaintenanceMaven">
    	Maven wiki page</a>.
