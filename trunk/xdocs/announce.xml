    <h4 id="a20060125.1">25 Jan 2006 - Struts Scripting 1.0.1 Released</h4>
    <p>
 	The Struts team is pleased to announce the release of Struts Scripting
	1.0.1 for General Availability. This is the first stable release of 
    Struts Scripting (formerly Struts BSF).  It allows Struts Actions to be
    written in the scripting language of one's choice rather than as Java
    classes. It uses the Bean Scripting Framework to allow scripts to be 
    written in any language BSF supports like Perl, Python, Ruby, 
    JavaScript, Groovy, and even VBScript.
    </p>
    <p>
	The binary and source distributions are available from the Struts
	download page:
	<a href="http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi">http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi</a>
    </p>
    <p>
	You can find out more information about Struts Scripting at

    <h4 id="a20060117.1">17 Jan 2006 - New Struts Committers: Jason Carreira
    and Patrick Lightbody</h4>
    <p>
    Please join me in welcoming Jason Carreira and Patrick Lightbody as new 
    Struts committers. Jason and Patrick are the core WebWork 2 developers 
    and they are joining us in an important step in the merger process.  I, and
    many other Struts committers, have personally met and talked at length with
    both Patrick and Jason on several occasions and find them dedicated, 
    skilled, and team players.  Their dedication to WebWork 2 over the years is
    a testament to their perseverance, commitment to their community, and
    technical skill. We look forward to their contributions as committers.
    </p>

    <p>

    <p>
	Please join us in welcoming Rich Feit as a new Struts committer. Rich is 
	a Beehive committer and PMC member. In addition to being a Struts user 
	for years (Beehive is built on Struts), he has been pivotal in designing 
	and coding Struts Ti, both the initial annotationed Beehive version and 
	the current WebWork merger effort. His experience in Struts migration 
	tools in particular will be key to making Struts Action a success. We 
	look forward to his continued contributions as a committer.

    <h4 id="a20051214.4">14 Dec 2005 - Apache Struts to release Struts 1.3.0 
    as the "Action Framework"</h4>
    <p>
	The Apache Struts flagship product, 
	the leading web application framework for Java, 
	is now known as the "Struts Action Framework". 
    </p>

    <p>
	To make the framework easier to maintain, 
	Apache Struts subdivided the original monolithic distribution into several 
	subprojects. 
	Each subproject has its own website, documentation, and release cycle, 
	and may be downloaded separately. 
	For consistency, the original core framework component also has its own name 
	now: "Struts Action Framework". 
	The JARs and external dependencies for the extensions to Struts Action Framework 
	are being bundled into a convenient distribution known as the "Struts Action 
	Framework Library".
    </p>

    <p>
	The Struts Action Framework 1.3.0 release will include several exciting new 
	features, including: 
    </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Composable Request Processor</li>
		<li>ActionDynaForm interfaces</li>
		<li>Arbitrary configuration properties</li>
		<li>Catalog and Command Elements</li>
		<li>Enhanced Global Exception Handlers</li>
		<li>Extends attribute for XML configurations</li>
	        <li>"isCommitted" Exception Handling</li>
	        <li>Postback Actions</li>
	        <li>Wildcard ActionConfig properties</li>
	</ul>
	        
    <p>
	The key change in this release is the "composable request processor". 
	The request processor is the framework's "kernal". 
	The request processor methods are now command objects in a flexible chain of 
	commands. 
	Rather than subclassing a monolithic object, 
	developers can now just replace commands with their own implementations. 
	Commands can also be inserted or removed, if needed, 
	to extend or streamline the request processing gauntlet, 
	to better meet the needs of different kinds of applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Struts Action Framework 1.3.0 release, 
        and other milestones on the Apache Struts roadmap, 
        were discussed at ApacheCon on Tuesday, December 13, 2005, in a talk, 
        entitled "Struts 2006: An Embarrassment of Riches".
        <a href="http://people.apache.org/~husted/apachecon-2005-action.pdf">

    <h4 id="a20051214.3">14 Dec 2005 - Apache Struts and Open Symphony WebWork 
    communities to merge</h4>
    <p>
	Apache Struts, 
	the leading web application framework for Java, and Open Symphony WebWork, 
	a leader in technical innovation, are working to merge their communities 
	and codebases. 
    </p>

    <p>
	"A merger is an elegant approach to evolution of existing applications 
	based on action-oriented frameworks," 
	said Craig McClanahan, founder of the Struts project. 
    </p>

    <p>
	The merger seems like a win-win for the frameworks. 
	"The technical benefit is that WebWork has already done most everything 
	that is on the Struts Action roadmap," noted Ted Husted, a Struts committer. 
	"This is a way that [Struts] shops can use incremental integration to take 
	advantage of new technologies that are already part of WebWork, such as Spring."
    </p>

    <p>
	"My hope is to take advantage of a larger community (Struts) to allow 
	all of us to do a bit less individual effort." 
	said Patrick Lightbody of WebWork. 
	"I would expect moving to Struts lets us focus on our families and day 
	jobs a bit more."
    </p>

    <p>
	Apache projects help developers balance day jobs with volunteer work 
	through the practice of collaborative developement. 
	Decisions are made jointly by the core community, 
	rather than by one or two key individuals. 
	The projects are organized so that individual developers can focus on 
	other matters for a time, 
	and then return to the development community as schedules allow. 
    </p>

    <p>
	Over the past few months, 
	Apache Struts has more than doubled its number of active committers. 
	With the addition of two WebWork developers, 
	there are about fifteen active volunteers. 
	Right now, about half of the committers are working on the original Struts 
	Action Framework and half are working on the new Struts Shale Framework, 
	which utilizes JavaServer Faces. 
	Several volunteers are now working with both frameworks.
    </p>

    <p>
	The merger and other milestones on the Apache Struts roadmap were discussed 
	in a talk at ApacheCon on Tuesday, December 13, 2005, entitled "Struts 2006: 
	An Embarrassment of Riches" 
	[http://people.apache.org/~husted/apachecon-2005-action.pdf]. 
	The talk will be presented by Lightbody, Husted, and Don Brown, another 
	Struts Committer. 
	The Struts Shale framework is being discussed at a second talk, 
	presented by McClanahan, entitled "Shale: The Next Struts??" 
	<a href="http://people.apache.org/~craigmcc/apachecon-2005-shale.pdf">
	Slides from the talk are available online</a>.

    <h4 id="a20051214.2">14 Dec 2005 - Apache Struts offers "Shale" for JSF</h4>
    <p>
	To give JavaServer Faces developers a head start on building scalable 
	web applications for the enterprise, 
	Apache Struts now offers the Shale Framework. 
	Like the original "Struts Action Framework", 
	Shale provides developers with a front controller, 
	and several other components, 
	to provide the "invisible underpinnings that hold an application together".
    </p>

    <p>
	"When JavaServer Faces arrived," 
	explains the Struts website, 
	"our development community chose to 'make new friends but keep the old'. 
	Some of us want (or need) to stick with the original request-based 
	framework. 
	Others are ready to switch to an component-based framework that builds on 
	JavaServer Faces. 
	We offer both frameworks because we have volunteers to create and maintain 
	both frameworks."
    </p>

    <p>
	Shale is based on the recently standardized JavaServer Faces APIs, 
	and focuses on adding value, 
	rather than redundantly implementing features that JSF already provides. 
	Shale will run on any compliant JSF implementation, 
	including the one being developed by the Apache MyFaces project. 
	It also includes many features that Struts users appreciate, 
	such as supporting client side validation and the Tiles framework.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Struts Shale was discussed by Craig McClanahan in a talk at ApacheCon on 
        Tuesday, December 13, 2005, entitled "Shale: The Next Struts??". 
        <a href="http://people.apache.org/~craigmcc/apachecon-2005-shale.pdf">Slides 
        from  the talk are available online</a>.

    <h4 id="a20051214.1">14 Dec 2005 - Apache Struts to release "standalone" Tiles</h4>
    <p>
	Apache Struts introduced Tiles as a integral component of its Struts 1.1 
	release in June 2003. 
	Since then, several other projects have been using Tiles, 
	even though it was embedded in the Struts JAR. 
	Soon, it will be much easier to use Tiles with products like Jakarta Velocity, 
	Apache MyFaces, and Struts Shale. 
    </p>
     
    <p>
	Tiles is a templating framework that can be used to create a common look and 
	feel for a web site or application and to create reusable view components. 
	A key aspect of Tiles is that it can be configured from a XML configuration file. 
	A Tile definition can "extend" another definition, 
	giving the component an object-oriented feel. 
	Tile developers can create a base Tile (or screen layout), 
	and then indicate only how other Tiles differ from the base. 
	Changes made to a base Tile "cascade" to Tiles that extend that base. 
	Significant changes can be made to the layout of a website 
	just by changing a single Tile definition.

    <h4 id="a20050217">17 Feb 2005 - New Struts subproject: Struts Flow</h4>    
    <p>
    	The Apache Struts team is pleased to announce the adoption of its latest
    	subproject, Struts Flow, a continuations-based approach to complex web 
    	workflows. Struts Flow orginated at the struts.sf.net project and has 
    	been formally adopted now as a Struts subproject. Struts Flow is a port 
    	of Apache Cocoon's Control Flow to Struts to allow complex workflow, 
    	like multi-form wizards, to be easily implemented using 
    	continuations-capable Javascript and eventually Java.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Today, Struts is comprised of nine subprojects: Core, Taglib, Tiles, El, 
    	Faces, Scripting, Applications, Shale, and (now) Flow. Struts Flow is 
    	different from Struts Scripting/BSF as where scripting brings any 
    	BSF-supported scripting language to Struts Actions, Struts Flow works on 
    	redefining the traditional Model 2 state-driven workflow into simplified 
    	scripots whos eexecute spans multiple requests. Currently, the Rhino 
    	engine, a Javascript implementation, is used to provide continuations 
    	support, but with the maturation of 
    	<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/sandbox/javaflow/">
    	Commans Javaflow</a> - a Java-based continuations implementation, 
    	Java will soon be supported as well.

    <p>
    	The Apache Struts team is pleased to announce the adoption of its latest
	subproject, Struts Shale, a JSF-based framework. The Shale codebase was
	initiated by Craig McClanahan in the Struts sandbox, and development
	traffic regarding Shale has steadily increased. As the product is heading
	towards an initial release, the Struts PMC felt it time to formally adopt
	Struts Shale as a subproject.
    </p>
    <p>
	Today, Struts is comprised of eight subprojects: Core, Taglib, Tiles, El,
	Faces, Scripting, Applications, and (now) Shale. An initiative is underway
	to extract the Struts Tiles code into a standalone product. Several Struts
	developers plan to apply to the ASF to incubate

    <h4 id="a20010615">15 Jun 2001 - Struts 1.0 Released</h4>

<p>
The production release of Struts 1.0, an open source framework for building Web applications, is now available for download at jakarta.apache.org. Struts encourages application architectures based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and provides services common
to most Web applications. Struts helps developers deploy products that are reliable, scaleable, and easier to maintain.
</p>

<p>
The Struts framework offers services in three primary areas:
</p>

<p>
* A controller servlet to dispatch requests to specific Action classes (provided by the application developer).<br/>
* JSP custom tags to help developers create interactive form-based applications.<br/>
* Utility classes for XML parsing, automatic JavaBean population, and internationalization of prompts and messages.
</p>

<p>
Struts' support for internationalization builds on top of the Java Locale API, and have made it a popular choice for applications worldwide. Struts contributors include developers from Australia, France, Russia, and other parts of the globe.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the Struts official distribution, several third-party libraries are already available, which offer enhanced support for JSP templates, HTML form validation, and automatic JavaBean creation. Struts has also been integrated with the Expresso Framework distributed by
JCorporate Ltd. (jcorporate.com).
</p>

<p>
Struts can be used with a J2EE Application server to deploy distributed applications, but will run under any compliant Servlet container (Servlet API 2.2+, JSP 1.1+), including Tomcat 3.2 or later. In fact, Struts is already used as an informal compliance test for Java Servlet
containers and J2EE Application servers
</p> 

<p>
The Struts project was founded in May 2000 by Craig McClanahan. McClanahan is also the lead developer of Tomcat 4.0, Sun's reference implementation for Java Servlet and ServerPage containers. Both Tomcat and Struts are open source available under the Apache Software License,
and may be downloaded at jakarta.apache.org.
</p>

<p>
Twenty-six independent developers contributed to the creation of Struts 1.0, with the help of over 1300 subscribers to the Struts mailing lists.<br/>
