            Here are answers to the some of the usual Apache Struts
            getting-started questions.

        <faq id="subprojects">
            <question>Why are there so many subprojects now?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Over the years, the Action framework grew to include not only a
                    controller and a set of taglibs but several other extensions,
                    like Tiles, EL, Scripting, and Flow. There were also some
                    optional classes that some people liked, but not everyone needed
                    (like DispatchAction).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Releasing all of this code together has been like hanging wall
                    paper. We smooth a crease here, and another wrinkle crops up over
                    there. In order to promote lighter, regular releases, we've
                    subdivided the monolithic Struts 1.2 distribution into seven
                    distinct subprojects: Action, EL, Extras, Site, Taglib, and
                    Tiles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, if we want to make a change to a JSP tag, we can release
                    Taglib without re-releasing everything else. Likewise, if we want
                    to add a nifty new Action to Extras, we can just release Extras,
                    without re-releasing everything else.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Of course, the next question is: "Which versions of work with the
                    "best available" release of Action?" To answer that question,
                    we provide the Struts Action Library, which contains the set of
                    JARs that work with the "best available" release of Action.

        <faq id="dependencies">
            <question>
                But what if a new feature in Taglibs depends on a new feature in
                Action? Won't you still have to release them together?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Hmmm, almost. This sort of thing already happens with the Commons
                    components. We might have to release a new version of Commons
                    Validator and test it against the development build of Struts
                    Action. The same thing would continue to happen. It's just
                    instead of
                    being a Commons component and a Struts component, it's two
                    Struts components. No big woof.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The difference is that now we get to choose what is released
                    together. The infrastructure does not make that decision for us.

        <faq id="confusing">
            <question>Won't it be confusing for people to bundle, say, Action 1.3.4
                with Taglib 1.3.2?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    We also bundle Action 1.3.0 with Commons-Validator 1.2.0.
                    and Commons-BeanUtils 1.7.0, and several other JARs with their
                    own version numbers. Same difference.

                <p>
                    To make it easy for people to grab the "best available"
                    combination of JARs, we offer the Struts Action Library.

                <p>Struts Classic is a codename for the work we needed to do to
                    create and release the seven new subprojects we extracted from
                    Struts 1.2. It is not a product per-se, but shorthand for the
                    1.3.0 build of the seven projects.

                    Shale is to JavaServer Faces what Action is to JavaServer
                    Pages.

        <faq id="struts">
            <question>If Shale is a new product, why is it called
                Struts?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Apache Struts embraces standards, and JavaServer Faces
                    (JSF) is a new standard.
                    JSF is not the first standard that Struts has assimilated
                    (and, undoubtedly, it will not be the last).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, many of the original Struts taglibs overlap
                    with the JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL).
                    Some of us want to continue using the original tags.
                    Others want to be able to use JSTL as much as possible.
                    As a result, David Karr created the Struts EL taglibs.
                    The Struts EL subproject provides JSTL versions of only
                    the Struts tags that do not overlap with JSTL.
                    Meanwhile, the original taglibs are available and
                    maintained for those that choose to use them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Likewise, some of us want to use JSF as much as possible.
                    Others want to continue using the original Action
                    framework.
                    As a result, Craig McClanahan created the Struts Shale
                    framework.
                    Shale provides the same utility as the Action framework by
                    building on the JSF feature set.
                    Since Shale does for JSF what Action does for JSP, we
                    consider Shale to be another Struts framework.

        <faq id="ti">
            <question>What about Ti? What about WebWork?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/struts/StrutsTi">Struts
                        Ti</a>
                    (short for Titanium) is a codename for Struts Action
                    Framework 2.x.
                    In late November 2005, the Ti proposal was amended to
                    include a merger with
                    <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork/">Open
                        Symphony WebWork</a>
                    .
                    Under this plan, the next stable release of WebWork is
                    being donated to Apache Struts,
                    and the lead WebWork committers are joining the Struts
                    community.
                    The WebWork codebase is being brought into the ASF through
                    the Apache Incubator.
                    Once licensing and related issues are resolved,
                    the codebase will be made part of the Apache Struts
                    framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    WebWork started as a
                    <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/learn/rules-for-revolutionaries.html">
                        Struts Revolution</a>
                    .
                    Over the years, it has evolved into a superb action-based
                    framework that retains many Struts 1.x paradigms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People who have worked with both Struts 1.x and WebWork
                    2.x tend to agree that it is a logical candidate for
                    Struts Action Framework 2.x.
                    If you look the Struts Action 1.x roadmap and the WebWork
                    2.x feature set,
                    you'll see that WebWork has already does most of what we
                    wanted Struts Action to do.
                    If we finished the roadmap ourselves, Struts Action would
                    end up as a WebWork workalike.
                    Rather than reinvent the wheel,
                    Ti has become a proposal to put the WebWork wheel back on
                    the Struts axle.

                    For the time being, there is no plan to migrate XWork to

                    well
                    at OpenSymphony, there is no reason to make further changes.

            <question>Do I have to credit Apache Struts on my own

            <answer>
                <p>You need to credit Apache Struts if you
                    <strong>redistribute your own framework</strong>
                    based on our products
                    for other people to use. (See the
                    <a href="http://www.apache.org/LICENSE">Apache License</a>
                    for details.)
                    But you do
                    <strong>not</strong>
                    need to credit Apache Struts just because your web
                    application utilizes one of our products.
                    It's the same situation as using the Apache HTTPD server
                    or Tomcat. Not required if its just running your web site.
                    Required if you've used the source code to create your own
                    server that you are redistributing to other people.

            <question>If a product doesn't do what I want, can I request that
                a feature be added?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    First, it's important to remember that Apache Struts is an
                    all-volunteer project.
                    We don't charge anyone anything to use Apache Struts
                    products.
                    Committers and other developers work on Apache Struts
                    products because they need to use it with their own
                    applications.
                    If others can use it too, that's "icing on the cake".
                    If you
                    <a href="../helping.html">submit a patch</a>
                    for a feature that a Committer finds useful, then that
                    Committer may choose to volunteer his or her time to apply
                    the patch.
                    If you just submit an idea without a patch, it is much
                    less likely to be added (since first someone else has to
                    volunteer their time to write the patch).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are grateful for any patches, and we welcome new ideas,
                    but the best way to see that something gets added to the
                    framework is to do as much of the work as you can, rather
                    than rely on the "kindness of strangers". Worst case, you
                    can apply the patch to your copy of Struts and still use
                    the feature in your own application. (Which is what open
                    source is ~really~ all about.)

                    Struts should work well with any development environment
