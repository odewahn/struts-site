            <p>
                I've been involved with servlet and JSP technology since around
                1998. It started out that I needed a way to build some web
                applications for several projects, and liked Java a lot better
                than the alternatives. I also liked the price tag of open source
                software, and started using Apache JServ -- later, getting
                involved in the project (like many people, I was whining about
                the twelve months it took to get from version 0.9 to version
                1.0, and my son said "Dad, you know Java -- go help them finish
                it!" -- so I did :-).</p>

            <p>
                For quite a while, I was participating a lot the JSP-INTEREST and
                SERVLET-INTEREST
                <a href="http://archives.java.sun.com">mailing lists</a>,
                especially the topic of good architectures for web applications.
                I was disgusted with the hash that many beginners created when
                they used (or abused) scriptlets in JSP pages, and built (for my
                former employer) a pretty comprehensive framework that could
                considered ("Struts 0.01 without the custom tags"). It was
                proprietary code, but I was able to describe the concepts, and
                there started to a feeling the lists that this "Model 2" thing
                was pretty cool -- but there were no good examples to look at,
                so it was mostly hand waving types of discussions.</p>

            <p>
                Over the same time period, I got involved as an individual
                contributor in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/jcp">Java
                Community Process</a>, and joined the expert group that defined
                the servlet 2.2 and JSP 1.1 specs. Sun was impressed enough to
                offer me a job as the technical lead the team within Sun
                (currently five other individuals) that works
                <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat">Tomcat</a> -- the
                architecture for Catalina, which is the servlet container part
                of Tomcat 4.0, is also mine -- so I am in the really nice
                position of getting paid to work open source software :-). And,
                participate the expert groups for Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2. And,
                speak at various conferences, including ApacheCon and JavaOne.
                And, talk to groups within Sun about using Struts and
                JSP/servlet technology. And ... (there's some really interesting
                things being considered for the future).
            </p>

            <p>
                The original design of what came to Struts has been in my head
                for a long time, since those interesting mailing list
                discussions, but the first version of the actual code was
                written my laptop a Memorial Day weekend vacation trip (end of
                May, 2000) to the Oregon coast -- in between watching the surf
                and having the house shaken by a windstorm at night. Since then,
                it has gathered attention and popularity as we approach our
                first official release, and it delights me to see my "baby" grow
                up so well :-). Of course, it is no longer just me -- there have
                been incredible numbers of good ideas from all over, and a peek
                at the TODO list for 1.1 says that even more good stuff is
                coming in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                One motivation factor was
                <a href="http://www.servlets.com/soapbox/problems-jsp.html">
                Jason Hunter's</a> article about the Problems with JSP. Jason
                and I get along fine, even though we have different preferences
                about presentation technologies. Besides being the author of a
                very popular book about servlets, with a second edition coming
                soon, Jason is also the representative for the Apache Software
                Foundation the Executive Committee of the Java Community
                Process.
            </p>

            <p>
                Personally, I live in Portland, Oregon (even though my team at
                Sun is mostly in Cupertino, CA -- staying here was part of the
                job deal :-). I like to support Oregon sports teams (Oregon
                State Beavers, Oregon Ducks, Portland Trailblazers) and work
                cool software.
            </p>

            <p>
                I figured out I was getting pretty old when I realized that
                2000 was the 25th year I had been paid to work in some aspect of
                software development :-). I've got a son who is a full-time
                software developer (primarily in PHP so far, but I'm going to
                corrupt him with Java eventually :-), and a daughter in college.
                I'll happily let the other committers speak for themselves.

            <p>
                I'm currently a student of computer science at Drexel University
                in Philadelphia, PA. I've been working at HP Middleware,
                formerly Bluestone Software for 3 years programming in Java and
                recently J2EE technologies. I'm a full time worker from
                September until April and a student and part time worker from
                April until August. In my spare time I've been known to run
                monkey-knife fights in a shady south philly warehouse. Err... I
                mean... nothing.
            </p>

            <h4 id="husted">Ted Husted -- PMC Member</h4>

            <p>
                In the late 1990s, I was working with a local PBS station to
                improve their web presence. Like most stations, WXXI had an
                annual fundraising auction. Each year, we would do a little more
                for the auction. At first, we posted a few static pages about
                the "big ticket" items. The next year, we accepted "pre-bids"
                on the more expensive items, using a JavaScript application.
             </p>

             <p>
                Then, late in 1999, the CEO decided we should do a lot more with the auction
                on the website. The next big step would be to accept bids for
                all items online. A colleague recommended FileMaker Pro, and we
                went to work automating the bid-taking process. For
                "Spring MarketPlace 2000", we entered the telephone bids into
                computers in the studio, and Internet users could enter their
                own bids directly.
             </p>

             <p>
                 The system worked, but we ran into some walls that were
                 difficult to work around. We also wanted to expand the
                 system to do scheduling and inventory as well as bid taking.
                 So, I started looking for a new platform. I came close to
                 selecting PHP, but there were some cool new Java products,
                 like Resin and Jetty, coming out in 2000. I was impressed and
                 decided to go with Java.
             </p>

             <p>
                 At the time, web application frameworks for Java were a new
                 idea, and only a couple were available.
                 I stumbled upon Struts at Jakarta, and started posting
                 questions to the list. At first, the list traffic was so low,
                 I wasn't sure if the group was still active. But, answers
                 came, and so I kept on posting.
             </p>

             <p>
                 To help teach myself the framework, I started a "walking
                 tour" of the infamous MailReader application. I posted the
                 tour as I wrote it, and people kindly corrected my
                 understanding of how things worked as I went.
             </p>

             <p>
                 In December 2000, Craig was asking for volunteers to help
                 with the documentation. Mike Schachter and I raised our
                 virtual hands, we became Struts committers 006 and 007.
             </p>

             <p>
                 By the Spring of 2001, WXXI's new auction application was ready
                 to ship using the Struts 1.0 beta. We took over 50,000 bids on
                 5,000 items with nary a hitch. We added an inventory module
                 for 2002, and the station continued to use the original
                 software unchanged through 2005.
             </p>

             <p>
                Since joining Struts in 2000, I've become a Member of the Apache
                Software Foundation and Struts Project Management Committee. My
                books include JUnit in Action, Struts in Action, and
                Professional JSP Site Design. I've consulted with Struts teams
                throughout the United States, including CitiGroup, Nationwide
                Insurance, and PepsiCo.
             </p>

             <p>
                Currently, I'm working with the Oklahoma State
                Department of Environmental Services to improve their permitting
                system. We started the work in Java, but the enterprise
                migrated to ASP.NET in 2004. Rather than quit the team,
                I stuck it out. We are now working on a Struts subproject for
                ASP.NET called OverDrive.

            <p>
                As a dreamer / researcher I have thought a lot about a framework
                like Struts. But, as a lazy developer I have first checked what
                already exists, and I have found Struts. Struts goals fulfilled
                nearly all I needed for my (now old) portal project, except the
                capability to reuse and assemble easily pieces of pages or
                components. So, I have proposed the Components framework. This
                framework can seen as a superset of the Templates tag library
                contributed by David Geary, and contains lot of interesting
                features.
            </p>

            <p>
                From a professional point of view, I have a Ph.D. in computer
                science. I have worked for 3 years in the R&amp;D department of
                a worldwide company developing Internet banking solutions.
                I am now a researcher at a university, and work European
                research projects. My main research interest is WWW, Distributed
                Systems and Object Oriented Design. When developing code, I
                always try to first propose reusable pieces of code.
            </p>

            <h4 id="martinc">Martin Cooper -- PMC Chair</h4>

            <p>
              Early in the year 2000, I was asked, by my employer at that time,
              to investigate the best way to develop a new web-based application
              for the administration and management of an existing product.
              After exploring a number of technologies, I settled on Java, along
              with servlets and JSP, as the way to go. Then I started looking
              for methodologies and "best practices", since others must surely
              have been down that path before me.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to rummaging around on the web, I subscribed to the
              SERVLET-INTEREST and JSP-INTEREST mailing lists, along with
              several others, and monitored the discussions for a while. It was
              clear that others were seeking the same answers as I was, and it
              was also clear that many people were building their applications
              in truly horrible ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              At some point -- I don't recall when, exactly -- the concept of
              "Model 1" versus "Model 2" applications came up, and there was a
              great deal of discussion around that. Model 2 seemed very much
              like A Good Thing to me, and I paid it close attention.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then, in May of 2000, I saw a message from Craig McClanahan
              about a new framework called Struts that was designed to ease
              the process of building Model 2 applications, and provide
              solutions for some of the important issues at the same time. I
              hopped on over to the web site and took a look around. This was
              exactly what I had been looking for.
            </p>

            <p>
              My first postings to the Struts mailing list were, of course,
              questions to help me understand how to do things and why Struts
              is the way it is. Over time, I became more involved in both the
              user and developer communities, started submitting bug reports,
              patches and change requests, and eventually became a committer.
              Not long after that, I volunteered to take on the release process,
              and became the release manager for Struts 1.0.1 and beyond. Little
              did I know what I was letting myself in for!
            </p>

            <p>
              A large majority of the people who contribute to Apache projects
              are volunteers who are not paid for their contributions. Like most
              of those volunteers, I also have a "day job" to put bread on the
              table. Currently, I am a UI Architect at Informatica, where I work
              on the architecture, design and implementation of web applications.
              Working with, and on, Struts has provided me with an excellent
              perspective with which to do that!

                As I worked web based projects I started looking for something
                that would really help save time during development. I ran
                across Struts in the Summer of 2000 and decided it was a good
                solution for web development. As I used Struts it really helped
                to remove a lot of the repetitive work, but validation still
                seemed very repetitive. I had an idea to create validation rules
                in an xml file and have them easily integrated with Struts. It
                started out simple and continued to develop over time. The
                validation project was eventually incorporated into Struts and
                the core was moved to Jakarta Commons. I'm happy to see Struts
                continue to grow and develop.</p>

            <p>
                I currently am employed at Forbes.com. I occasionally get to do
                some internal projects using Struts. The last interesting
                project was a publishing system using Message Driven EJBs in
                JBoss and Struts was used to display the status of each
                publishing process.

                I have gone from Unix -to- Windows -to- Unix based development
                about ever 6 years now. When moving to Windows I was amazed at
                how primitive the OS was compared to Unix. While developing for
                Win32 I had the pleasure of discovering Delphi and developed
                many GUI/databases, telephony, Internet enabled applications. I
                remain impressed with its design. Delphi, always enabled
                development of a simple elegant solution, much like the language
                itself. I was convinced after 10 years of development with C/C++
                that it was a kinder gentler language.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then in July 2000 I decided to move into Java, and Web
                development. This is after using the Internet since 1985 and
                occasionally teaching classes about it. I was hired as a
                consultant to take over a JSP based application. I realized it
                had been written with the equivalent of "goto's"(Model 1) and
                had to be redesigned. I searched for a better way to design the
                code and by late August I had found Struts. It is also a simple
                elegant solution.
            </p>

            <p>
                To date I have mainly served to pitch in where needed. I
                continue to amazed at the Struts committers' generous
                contributions of time, insight, and good will. I feel fortunate
                to part of the struts team.

                I, like many others, discovered Struts when contemplating
                writing my own MVC Java framework for the web. Struts had
                everything I needed and more so I scrapped plans for my own and
                joined the mailing lists. After playing with it for several
                months I started submitting documentation and a few source
                patches. I'm excited about helping Struts evolve and am
                continually amazed by the framework and the community
                surrounding it.

                Struts was forced upon me when the E-Commerce sweat-shop...errr
                ...I mean "the company I worked for" decided to go from being a
                full fledged Microsoft Partner to a full J2EE shop.  That was
                back in 2000.  What little skills in Java I had were poor at
                best and I had never heard of Struts or even Tomcat for that
                matter.

                I was fortunate to have several excellent mentors watching over
                my shoulder and helping our team cross the "great divide"
                between ASP/COM and Java/OOP.  You could say our mentors knew a
                thing or two about Java, web development, and frameworks in
                general.  Chuck Cavaness, Brian Keeton, and many more, I cannot
                thank you enough for all the leadership and guidance you have
                given me (and others).  I truly believe that without your help,
                I would not be where I am today.

                Where am I today?  That depends on who you ask ;)  I own my own

                Atlanta (GA) area.  I created the
                <a href="http://www.struts-atlanta.org">Struts-Atlanta Users

                enthusiasts and we meet monthly to discuss just about anything,
                not just Struts.I don't want this to sound like a resume, but if

                I call myself an "Open Source Evangelist" for a reason.  I use
                the word "Evangelist" because that's what I feel I am doing.
                Just as Martin Luther was considered a rebel in his day, I too
                hope to make a change.  I hope to change the way Software is
                developed in our world and how the lack of collaboration for
                the sake of "intellectual property" is inhibiting the growth of
                our economy. I believe businesses have a right to make a profit.
                I believe businesshave a right to make a profit on their
                "intellectual property", but for heaven's sake, some wheels
                don't needto be reinvented 50,000 times.  Where I draw the line
                is when they leverage existing market share to strong-arm the
                competition literally out of business.  Based on what I just
                wrote and depending on what you've been exposed to in your
                career, you might be thinking of one company right now.  You are
                probably right in your assumption, but believe me, there are
                many companies that practice the same, or worsetechniques.  To
                them, it's not about playing on a level playing field, it's
                about getting to the game early,buying 80% of the seats, and
                paying off the officials so there is little chance for any real
                competition.  Ofcourse, for some companies, it doesn't hurt if
                you own the stadium and keep the other players locked out.

                popular.</p>

            <p>
                Compared to what I want to do in life, Struts is just a drop in
                the pond.  However, that said, I am very happy and excited to be
                a part of this (and other) open source projects.  Thanks for

            <p>
                I discovered Struts somewhat by accident. In 2001 I began
                writing a book for SAMS on JSP web development (MySQL and JSP
                Web Development), and as part of it, I decided to write a
                chapter on Struts in the advanced section. In the process of
                learning enough about Struts to write about it, I realized that
                it could simplify some of the projects that I was working on for
                clients.
            </p>

            <p>
                After a half a year of working with Struts, I was asked by SAMS
                to write another book, this time concentrating on Struts
                specifically. That book, co-authored with a former co-worker n
                amed Kevin Bedell, became Struts Kick Start.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the process of writing that book, I began to realize that
                there were things I could do to contribute to Struts beyond
                writing about it. One thing in particular was to clean up and
                add some functionality to the Commons Validator project, which
                eventually led to me release-managing (with a lot of help!) the
                Commons Validator 1.0 release.
            </p>

            <p>
                More generally, I've been a software developer for over 22
                years, starting with work as a Research Specialist at the MIT AI
                Lab. I spent nearly a decade working in LISP, before moving on
                to C/Unix, a stint managing the Web Site for the Christian
                Science Monitor, and finally Java based e-Commerce development,
                which has kept me busy for the last five years.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to the two books mentioned above, I also write for a
                number of publications, including WIRED and the aforementioned
                Christian Science Monitor. You can get a look at my portfolio
                <a href="http://www.blackbear.com/monitor.html">here</a>.  I'm
                also working on a third book with a bunch of other folks for
                O'Reilly, which will cover Apache Axis.  I also edit the
                OpenSolaris.org site for Sun.

            <p>
              My first experiences with Java made me wince.  The language
              was young-ish still and growing by leaps and bounds all the time.
              To me, it seemed unintelligent to invest any significant
              intellectual resources in learning it because I perceived it as
              such a &quot;moving target&quot;.  Of course, that has changed.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'd been looking for a way to really do heavy-duty processing of
              web requests that was higher-level than CGI.  In particular, I
              was on a quest to find somethiong that did not involve using
              Microsoft (tm) technologies.  A friend of mine started
              chatting up the idea of Java servlets and JSP pages.  I didn't
              really like the idea of using Java because of my previously
              formed opinion, but, having a great deal of respect for my
              friend's opinion, I set out on an exursion to delve into the
              world of Java-driven dynamic web page generation.
            </p>

            <p>
              The language (and myself) had matured considerably by this time,
              and I found my previous inhibitions were no longer well founded.
              However, as much as I liked the technology, I was dissatisfied.
              There just had to be a better way!  I loved the concept of
              having a controller servlet, but, lacking experience in building
              externally-configurable Java &quot;thingies&quot;, I was
              hard-coding a lot, and, after a point, that started to really
              rub me wrong.  At this point, I started buying books and really
              &quot;studying&quot; the technology more seriously.
            </p>

            <p>
              I honestly don't recall where I stumbled onto Struts, but I do
              recall having toyed with a number of different frameworks - none
              of which I really recall now.  I quickly fell in love with
              Struts -- partially because it was an Apache project, and
              partially because it was evident to me that the project had a
              really great user-base.
            </p>

            <p>
              As time rocked along, I found myself becoming more deeply
              involved in the project.  I studied the source and learned a
              great deal about architecting configurable Java
              &quot;thingies&quot;, and learned a fantastic amount about
              actually using the framework.
            </p>

            <p>
              In time, I got comfortable enough with how Struts was structured
              that I began submitting patches - mostly documentation, which
              Ted Husted &quot;massaged&quot; and applied.  I enjoyed the
              feeling of gratification I got from helping to make Struts
              better, even if minorly.
            </p>

            <p>
              My last patch submitted as a non-committer was for ActionServlet.
              This was back when Struts 1.1 was working toward GA release.  It
              was the first patch I hadn't had applied within a few days of
              submission and I grew impatient.  Modules did not work properly
              without it and they did with it!  &quot;How can they not apply
              that patch when it's so critical to Struts?&quot; I thought to
              myself.
            </p>

            <p>
              Well, to keep this book from becoming a novel, I started a
              campaign to have the patch applied which resulted in
              my gaining committer status and applying the patch myself!
              I should note that Steve Ditlinger and myself collaborated on the
              patch.  I submitted a version, he made some suggestions and
              submitted an altered patch, and then we, collectively, decided
              to make a couple of other modifications, which I applied just
              before committing the patch.

              I've worked as a developer since 1988 using various technologies/platforms.
              In the late nineties I kept meaning to learn java but never found the time
              until 2000. I bought a couple of books (Java in 30 Days and a Certification
              Study Guide), passed the Sun certification exam and got my first java job.

              Early in 2001 I was investigating writing the first web app for the company
              I was working for and came across Struts - just before the 1.0 beta was
              released. After a while I came off the user list because of the volume of
              traffic and just monitored the developers list. Late in 2003 I migrated to
              Struts 1.1, re-joined the user list and started submitting a few patches.
              Was invited to become a Struts Committer in May 2004 and PMC member in 
              September 2004.

               I started working with Java early in 2000.  We designed and implemented a
               servlet-based application that to this day gives me and a fellow designer
               the urge to do a total rewrite.  On my next assignment, somebody
               introduced me to a series of patterns useful for web applications.  We
               built a framework using these patterns and it worked out well for us.
             </p>
             <p>
               When I tried to bring this framework into the next project, somebody
               suggested using Struts instead.  The two frameworks resembled each other
               so closely that we had no trouble at all switching.  One of the things
               missing in Struts was an easy way to do redirects with parameters, so we
               wrote our own class for that.  The same guy who suggested Struts
               suggested I contribute it to Struts.  A few months after that, I joined
               the mailing lists and sought how to contribute.
             </p>
             <p>
               I found myself enjoying answering questions on the user list.  After some
               time, I was participating on the dev list as well.  Soon I was able to
               contribute a few patches and even came up with my own Struts extension.
               In February of 2005, I accepted an invitation to be a committer, and
               in July 2005, accepted an invitation to join the PMC.

            <p>In late 2001, I was asked to put information from a database on
            the web, including a few forms to allow updates. By that time I had
            been working with Java for a couple of years in class projects, but
            "Servlet" was still a foreign word. With no real deadline and
            complete freedom to pick anything I wanted, I spent hours online
            searching and participating in different forums and lists. And any
            time I asked for advice using 'Java' and 'HTML forms' in the same
            sentence, I got a resounding chorus of "Struts!" in reply.</p>

            <p>That first webapp went through quite a few iterations as I tried
            and discarded various things. But I kept coming back to Struts, and
            eventually things fell into place-- thanks mostly to the helpful
            community on the struts-user list. As I gained more experience,
            asking questions on the user list naturally transformed into
            answering them, which I've been doing ever since. I accepted an
            invitation to become a Struts Committer in June, 2005.</p>
       
            <h4 id="gvanmatre">Gary VanMatre -- Committer</h4>
            
            <p>I landed an internship in college working with the big blue iron where 
            I dappled in the craft of VSE COBOL and JCL. Through the 90's, I worked my 
            way into several client-server technologies (Visual Basic, PowerBuilder and Delphi) 
            and finally thought that I had learned the last programming language I 
            would ever need to know, Fort&#233; Transactional Object Oriented language (TOOL).</p>
            
            <p>I rode the Fort&#233; wave for several years and suddenly found myself 
            looking for work and feeling like a real "tool". An empty, dust free 
            self was just the right size for the proprietary distributed object 
            solution once called Fort&#233;.</p>
            
            <p>In 2002, is when I found Java. While working a VB assignment, 
            I decided the only hope I had of getting a competitive edge was to 
            become a Sun Certified Java Programmer. With that card, I found an 
            opportunity to become a Struts developer and began lurking about the 
            Struts mailing lists in 2003.</p>
            
            <p>In late 2004, I started hearing a buzz about a new Struts subproject 
            and became very interested in the ideas. I also began acquiring a stack 
            of JSF books matching my Struts collection.  My experience with Struts, 
            Tiles and something that Colorado Department of State calls Rustts, gave 
            me the idea that has become known as the Shale "Clay" plug-in. I was 
            invited to become a Struts Committer in July 2005.</p>
