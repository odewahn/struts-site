<section name="Welcome to Apache Struts!">
    <p>
        The goal of the Apache Struts project is to encourage application
        architectures based on the "Model 2" approach, a variation of the
        classic Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm.
        Under Model 2,
        a servlet (or equivalent) manages business logic execution,
        and presentation logic resides mainly in server pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Apache Struts project encourages Model 2 designs in two ways.
        First, by providing open source frameworks and toolkits
        that help developers build applications for the web.
        Second, by providing friendly and honest mailing lists
        where both newcomers and veterans discuss how to use Struts software
        in their own Model 2 applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        Originally, the Apache Struts software was distributed
        as one monolithic bundle.
	Today, the Apache Struts project is comprised of two distinct frameworks 
	and several other subprojects. 
	The two frameworks are the <strong>Struts Action Framework</strong> and 
	the <strong>Struts Shale Framework</strong>. 
	Struts Action is the original request-based framework. 
	Struts Shale is a component-based framework based on JavaServer Faces. 
	Both frameworks are first-class citizens of the Apache Struts project.
    </p>

   <a name="frameworks"/>
   <subsection name="Why two frameworks?">
   <p>
	When <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/javaserverfaces/">JavaServer Faces arrived</a>, 
	our development community chose to "make new friends but keep the old". 
	Some of us want (or need) to stick with the original request-based framework. 
	Others are ready to switch to an component-based framework that builds on JavaServer Faces. 
	We offer both frameworks because we have volunteers to create and maintain both frameworks.
    </p>

    <p>
	If you are starting a new project, you might want to consider our Shale Framework.
	Some people feel that JSF and Shale is the quickest way to write new Java web applications.
    </p>

    <p>	
	If you have mature Action Framework applications in production, don't worry, 
	we are still here, same as ever. 
	After all, we have our share of mature application in production too.
    </p>

    <p>	
	To make the Struts Action Framework easier for us to maintain, 
	we've subdivided the original monolithic distribution into several subprojects. 
	Each subproject has its own website, documentation, and release cycle, 
	and may be downloaded separately. 
	The JARs and external dependencies for our extensions to Struts Action are being 
	bundled into a convenient distribution known as the "Struts Action Library".

    <subsection name="About Apache Struts">
    <p>
        Apache Struts is a volunteer project and
        all support for the framework is provided by unpaid volunteers.
        This documentation bundle and the mailing lists are the primary ways
        to learn how to use Struts.
        The next few pages are devoted to helping you understand
        what resources are available to you.
        Since Apache Struts is a volunteer project,
        and our resources are limited,
        it is important that we first help you help yourself.
