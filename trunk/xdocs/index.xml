        <section name="Welcome to Apache Struts!">
            <p>
                The goal of the Apache Struts project is to encourage
                application
                architectures based on the "Model 2" approach, a variation of
                the
                classic Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm.
                Under Model 2,
                a servlet (or equivalent) manages business logic execution,
                and presentation logic resides mainly in server pages.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Apache Struts project encourages Model 2 designs in two
                ways.
                First, by providing open source frameworks and toolkits
                that help developers build applications for the web.
                Second, by providing friendly and honest
                <a href="mail.html">mailing lists</a>
                where both newcomers and veterans discuss how to use Apache Struts
                software in their own Model 2 applications.

                <p>
                    The Apache Struts project is now comprised of two distinct
                    frameworks.
                    The two frameworks are the
                    <strong>Struts Action Framework</strong>
                    and the
                    <strong>Struts Shale Framework.</strong>
                    Struts Action is the original request-based framework.
                    Struts Shale is a component-based framework for JavaServer Faces.
                    Both frameworks are first-class citizens of the Apache Struts
                    project.
                </p>

                <p>

                    <b>Why two frameworks?</b>
                    When
                    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/javaserverfaces/">
                        JavaServer Faces</a>
                    arrived, our development community chose to "make new friends but
                    keep the old".
                    Some of us want to stick with a request-based framework.
                    Others are ready to switch to a component-based framework
                    that builds on JavaServer Faces.
                    We offer both frameworks because we have volunteers to
                    create and maintain both frameworks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you have mature Action Framework applications in
                    production, don't worry,
                    we are still here, same as ever.
                    After all, we have our share of mature application in
                    production too.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you are starting a new project want to use the latest
                    technology,
                    don't worry, we are still blazing trails, same as ever.
                    For projects using JavaServer Faces, we offer the Shale
                    Framework.
                    For projects using JSP and templating technologies, we offer the
                    original Action framework.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Is that all there is?</b>
                    Not by a long shot!
                    Soon, we will also offer a new Action 2 framework, based on
                    <a href="announce.html#a20051214.3">WebWork</a>
                    technology. Essentially, Struts Action 2.0 will be WebWork 2.3.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whether you are staying the course, or ready to leap forward,
                    the Apache Struts project is here to help you do what you want
                    to do.

            <subsection name="About Apache Struts">
                <p>
                    Apache Struts is a volunteer project and
                    all support for the framework is provided by unpaid
                    volunteers.
                    This documentation bundle and the mailing lists are the
                    primary ways
                    to learn how to use Struts.
                    The next few pages are devoted to helping you understand
                    what resources are available to you.
                    Since Apache Struts is a volunteer project,
                    and our resources are limited,
                    it is important that we first help you help yourself.
